This clumping of red blood cells to each other in the presence of certain viruses, bacteria, plant proteins, or antibodies is known as haemagglutination and the viral protein responsible is known as a haemagglutinin (HA). </s><s n="s5.10;p2.14">Agglutination is due to the presence of multiple binding sites on the virus and the host cell (RBC in this case) for each other. </s><s n="s6.10;p2.14">As this attachment, causing haemagglutination is specific and unpredictable, it can be used as a diagnostic tool. </s><s n="s7.10;p2.14">For example, influenza virus attach to red blood cells (RBC) to form haemagglutination, which can easily be seen with naked eye. </s><s n="s8.10;p2.14">Another method of virus identification is through a known antiserum. </s><s n="s9.10;p2.14">An antiserum blocks the attachment of the virus to the host cell and prevents haemagglutination. </s><s n="s10.10;p2.14">Just as haemagglutination is precise, antibodies preventing the attachments of the viruses to the cell-surface receptors of red blood cells (RBC) is specific and this property form the basis of the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and can be used to identify an unknown virus. </s></p><p n="p3.14"><s n="s1.5;p3.14">The specificity of haemagglutination lies in the interaction between the virus and the host cell's surface. </s><s n="s2.5;p3.14">The virus binds to receptors on the host cell and as these receptors or domains differ in shape and complexity, a type of virus can only interact with certain host cells. </s><s n="s3.5;p3.14">This brought about this precise interaction. </s><s n="s4.5;p3.14">There are two main domains: a complex polypeptide motif or a simpler carbohydrate motif. </s><s n="s5.5;p3.14">In haemagglutination, it is due to binding to a carbohydrate motif. </s></p><p n="p4.14"><s n="s1.5;p4.14">Furthermore, the haemagglutination can be used to determine the original amount or concentration of virus or antibody in the stock. </s><s n="s2.5;p4.14">The original stock is serially diluted and the size of agglutination of the RBCs is compared to find the end point, where there is only a slight haemagglutination. </s><s n="s3.5;p4.14">Further dilution will results in inadequate amount of virus to cause agglutination. </s><s n="s4.5;p4.14">The amount of virus which just able to agglutinate a fixed number of RBCs is defined as 1 HA unit of virus and the concentration of virus per volume can be calculated and thus the HA titre of the undiluted stock determined. </s><s n="s5.5;p4.14">The same method is used to determine the HI titre, which is one HI unit of antiserum per reaction volume at which HA inhibition is last seen. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Method</head><p n="p5.14"><s n="s1.2;p5.14">All the steps in the

2-fold dilutions (2 to 12). </s></p><p n="p7.14"><s n="s1.7;p7.14">In the determination of the HI titre, 4 different controls were used and the original virus is diluted to contain approximately 160 HA units/ml. </s><s n="s2.7;p7.14">50µl of the original virus stock and 1950µl of PBS were mixed to obtain the required 160 HA units/ml of virus. </s><s n="s3.7;p7.14">The first control (C1) contained 100µl of PBS and 25µl of the diluted virus but no antibody. </s><s n="s4.7;p7.14">The second control (C2) contained 100µl of PBS and 10µl of antibody X but no virus. </s><s n="s5.7;p7.14">The third
