William Mackinnon's British East Africa Company, Cecil Rhodes' British South Africa Company and the British East India Company (EIC) in Asia would seek to reinforce the pattern of British colonial rule: the ideal situation being that of an informal empire, which would allow effective economic exploitation without the additional costs of setting up a governing administrative body and the moral

America (in particular Argentina) and the other white-settlement former colonies (Canada and Australia). </s><s n="s5.5;p5.14">Moreover, very few colonies were actually profit-making entities, with

cannot be overlooked, though many have dismissed it as a cloak for economic exploitation, there is still much to be said about Social Darwinism, the "White Man's Burden" and the moral responsibility attached to it. </s><s n="s2.7;p6.14">In the light of the Enlightenment ideas of the link between change and progress, and Darwin's theory of evolution, to remain stagnant was to be weak. </s><s n="s3.7;p6.14">This change in ideas also marked a change in the perceptions of the colonial masters, who increasingly stressed the difference between the cultures of the metropolis and the colonies. </s><s n="s4.7;p6.14">Also, the advent of Science in promoting such racist ideas succeeded in explaining irrational beliefs in rational terms '...evolutionary explanation of racial differentiation and

to educate the natives in the colonial language, proper dressing (wearing shoes), western consumerism, and very importantly, through the spread of religion (Christian or Catholic faith). </s><s n="s7.7;p6.14">Another feature of the 'White Man's Burden' would be that of humanitarian concerns (whether rhetoric or reality), such as the abolishment of slavery in all French and British colonies,

argued that the colonisation of Vietnam was partly the result of the French desire to protect their missionaries in Vietnam from official persecution. </s><s n="s3.3;p7.14">However, the French were unique in believing in the universality of French values, and the perfectibility of human kind, and this perception was not evident amongst the other European colonial masters, who generally, as a

point of view, it must be said that where economic and humanitarian interests were conflicting, the former would always triumph. </s><s n="s2.5;p8.14">Empirical observations regarding the sale of opium to Britain's Southeast Asian colonies, and that of 'trader gin' (a noxious but potent narcotic) in West Africa are telling of the priority of economic over humanitarian concerns. </s><s n="s3.5;p8.14">Abolishment of slavery was possible because it benefited both parties. </s><s n="s4.5;p8.14">Also, the presence of missionaries/explorers such as David Livingston could not compete with

'humanitarian reasons', only to use the local population as slave labourers. </s></p><p n="p9.14"><s n="s1.5;p9.14">Though it is extremely difficult to argue that cultural influences were the direct

but acceptable." </s><ref target="BAWE_0019b-ftnote.012"/><s n="s2.5;p9.14">The consequences of cultural transfers are still seen in our modern world, where the colonies largely taken on the parliamentary model of their former colonial masters. </s><s n="s3.5;p9.14">This change has its roots in the era of colonisation where the indigenous political and often social hierarchy was replaced by the political institutions and protocol of the metropolis. </s><s n="s4.5;p9.14">The adoption of the colonial language as the working language, the western architecture of new buildings and the assimilation into the cash-economy, are all examples of the transfer of culture. </s><s n="s5.5;p9.14">Similarly, there were many ways in which the natives have inspired European art and lifestyle.

examination of purely economic and cultural aspects of imperialism has failed to truly grasp the essence of this significant event in history. </s><s n="s2.3;p10.14">The economic and cultural aspects were more of consequences rather than the causes of imperialism, and should be put in their correct places, under the broader themes of Power, Rivalry (stemming from Nationalism), Fear and Regeneration, which are interrelated concepts. </s><s n="s3.3;p10.14">Even so, the economic and cultural consequences were in fact additional benefits to be gained from imperialism, and not the actual aims that the imperialists wanted to achieve. </s></p><p n="p11.14"><s n="s1.6;p11.14">The acquiring of colonies was seen by many countries as the means by which they could attain the status of world power. </s><s n="s2.6;p11.14">This is particularly so for new countries like Italy and Germany, which saw their participation in imperialism as heightening their world standing. </s><s n="s3.6;p11.14">For an established nation like Britain however, imperialism was a defensive reaction, derived from a sense of insecurity and threats from newly industrialising powers like Germany, America and Russia, and the subsequent assertion of her power. </s><s n="s4.6;p11.14">As for France, she saw imperialism as the opportunity for the expansion of her army and navy; the role successful imperialism would play in exorcising her defeat in the Franco-Prussian war of 1871, and rebuild her status as a world power. </s><s n="s5.6;p11.14">Germany's fear of encirclement also played a part in the formulation of 'Weltpolitik'. </s><s n="s6.6;p11.14">It was not only the external fear that countries were trying to undermine each other in the race for colonies, but more importantly, there was the fear of internal degeneration, and that imperialism was the cure to the diagnosis of national ills, revitalising the country, restoring its self confidence, and reinforcing its power abroad. </s></p><p n="p12.14"><s n="s1.5;p12.14">Imperialism was often the exclusive prerogative of a small group of elites, but when the issue of national pride was at stake, and rivalry ensued, the public could often be aroused into supporting imperialist policies (clearly seen in the example of France.) </s><s n="s2.5;p12.14">Germany's aggressive 'Weltpolitik' (World policy) to secure her 'place in the sun' was an extension of the Anglo-German rivalry towards the end of the nineteenth century. </s><s n="s3.5;p12.14">Perhaps it can be suggested that, the above arguments regarding economic and cultural aspects were merely the manifestation of the broader concept of European rivalry. </s><s n="s4.5;p12.14">Linked to this concept is the theme of nationalism. </s><s n="s5.5;p12.14">The situation in Europe was balancing on a knife-edge after the unification of Italy and Germany, and the outward movement of expanding into a vast territory of unconquered plains was profitable not only as a safe outlet for the consumptive force of nationalism, but also to maintain the balance of power in Europe (Africa as the periphery of Europe). </s></p><p n="p13.14"><s n="s1.3;p13.14">Finally, there is the suggestion put forward by some historians that it was the domestic situation in Europe itself that led to imperialism. </s><s n="s2.3;p13.14">Social Imperialism, whereby '...expansionist policies are consciously devised to unite the nation and to defuse tensions at home, while simultaneously avoiding significant domestic reforms." </s><ref target="BAWE_0019b-ftnote.013"/><s n="s3.3;p13.14">In addition, the German 'Sammslungpolitik' (the gathering together of the elements that would naturally support the state) against the domestic threat from the Social Democrats, which coincided with their enthusiasm for imperialism, would seek to reinforce this theory. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0019b-ftnote.013"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Porter, <hi rend="italic">European Imperialism</hi>, p.32. </s></p></note><p n="p14.14"><s n="s1.4;p14.14">In conclusion, it is inadequate to understand imperialism primarily either as an economic or cultural phenomenon, simply because both were secondary concerns in the impetus to colonise. </s><s n="s2.4;p14.14">Economic determinism is the prerogative of Marxist historians, and it should be kept this way; for the vast majority of the other historians who have attempted to write about imperialism have placed due recognition to the other factors that have contributed to the motives of imperialism, which provide a more balanced view of this phenomenon. </s><s n="s3.4;p14.14">Moreover, the question specifically refers to European, and not British imperialism, hence, the assertion of economic interests as the primary force in imperialism would seem highly Anglo-centric in the light of the arguments put forth in this essay. </s><s n="s4.4;p14.14">It is perhaps more accurate to see the economic and cultural aspects as being the consequences of imperialism, and since 'primarily' suggests some sense of causation, it would be myopic to insist upon a direct answer to this question.
