n="s2.6;p3.8">Davis is unique in asserting that because there were no concrete evidences of the 'Ranter's' practical antinomianism, therefore they do not exist. </s><s n="s3.6;p3.8">Even if such evidences were in existence, Davis would most likely reject them as sensationalism of the yellow press, or as unreliable stories conjured up by seventeenth century anti-'Ranter' pamphleteers. </s><s n="s4.6;p3.8">However, Hill points to evidence that Gerrard Winstanley experienced problems in his Digger colony, due to the presence of drinking, whoring and indolent 'Ranters', and makes a point,

'practical antinomianism' that Davis seeks. </s><s n="s5.6;p3.8">The 'Ranters' hedonistic 'make love not war' sort of attitude constituted a critique of society, which manifested itself in the breaking of taboos, as opposed to the more taxing alternative of a violent overhaul of society. </s><s n="s6.6;p3.8">There is a more cogent explanation proposed by Hill that accounts for the lack of 'practical antinomianism'-it is simply that the Ranters were "talkers rather than doers." <ref target="BAWE_0019d-ftnote.013"/> </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0019d-ftnote.009"><p n="pn1.1"><s

</s><ref target="BAWE_0019d-ftnote.014"/><s n="s2.8;p4.8">While it is true that the antinomian and spiritualist ideas were not unique to the 'Ranters', according to Capp "it is clear that something

between Salmon, Webb and Coppe, which indicated a sense of familiarity to the point of intimacy. </s><s n="s4.8;p4.8">Though he concedes that Coppe and Clarkson were never close, nevertheless, he asserts that there were links between both groups<ref target="BAWE_0019d-ftnote.015"/>, hence refuting Davis's claim that "the Ranter core shatters and disintegrates." </s><ref target="BAWE_0019d-ftnote.016"/><s n="s5.8;p4.8">As mentioned earlier, the search for a seventeenth-century group labelled the 'Ranters' eludes Davis precisely because he employs modern standards and preconceptions to study a seventeenth-century phenomenon. </s><s n="s6.8;p4.8">Davis's insistence in finding a certain measure of uniformity or convergence of ideas will not hold up even in the globalised world today, where common church denominational labels mask a whole range of disparate practices and beliefs. </s><s n="s7.8;p4.8">Seventeenth-century radical groups were even less likely to converge on not more than a few tenets which roughly separated them from the other movements, not forgetting as well, that there was a great deal of fluidity between the groups, as people shopped around for a belief system that appealed to them. </s><s n="s8.8;p4.8">The 'Ranters' were such a loose grouping precisely because of their nature as a subversive group, their wariness of any forms of organised religion and distaste for hierarchy, which makes them not unlike modern anarchist 'groups' in form. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0019d-ftnote.014"><p n="pn1.1"><s

recantations of Coppe, Clarkson and others is puzzling in light of his scepticism with regards to seventeenth century anti-'Ranter' writings. </s><s n="s3.11;p5.8">In contrast, Hill accounts for this readiness to recant as a feature characteristic of 'Ranters', who, like their sixteenth-century predecessors, the Familists, practiced "Nicodemism-recanting in the face of overwhelming power"<ref target="BAWE_0019d-ftnote.017"/> and warns us against taking their equivocal recantations seriously. </s><s n="s4.11;p5.8">This practice can also be seen as the direct consequence of the 'Ranter' belief in 'mortalism', which precludes the immortality of the soul and hence of the appeal of martyrdom. </s><s n="s5.11;p5.8">As Hill astutely points out "...resistance to the death would call for a deeper and more consistently worked out ideology than most Ranters had." </s><ref target="BAWE_0019d-ftnote.018"/><s n="s6.11;p5.8">The two historians also disagree as to whether the 'Ranters' were the main targets of the Blasphemy Act of 1650. </s><s n="s7.11;p5.8">If Parliament had regarded the ideas and behaviour of the 'Ranters' as a real threat to societal order, then Davis's hypothesis that the Ranters did not exist is weakened. </s><s n="s8.11;p5.8">Though Davis is correct in saying that the Blasphemy Act did not mention the Ranters, evidence points towards Clarkson's <hi rend="italic">A Single Eye All Light</hi> as a trigger to the body of legislation, which according to McGregor "was largely a description of Ranter doctrine, owing much to the writings of Coppe and

Aylmer's simple concept that there can be "no smoke without fire". </s><s n="s10.11;p5.8">To take the analogy further, the strength of the fire might be disproportionately small compared to the amount of smoke that is billowing, and the response of the fire fighters might be more than is required to deal with a small fire, but the fact remains that a small fire did exist. </s><s
