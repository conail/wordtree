if they recognize it, he is their master as long as he proves himself." </s><ref target="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.003"/><s n="s7.13;p3.10">The conditional status of his power can be de-stabilising in that Hitler is under constant pressure to bring in success. </s><s n="s8.13;p3.10">Failure, or a series of failure (Operation 'Barbarossa' against Russia) would mean that the mandate was passing out of the hands of Hitler. </s><s n="s9.13;p3.10">Routinisation (the lapse back into normality) was also a threat to a regime that innately relied on dynamism to rule. </s><s n="s10.13;p3.10">Hence, the 'charismatic' form of leadership was 'an extraordinary, unstable and therefore transient form of rule, tending to arise in unusual or crisis conditions, and directed not at the solutions of everyday problems of government, but at the over-coming of supra-dimensional crises and emergencies." </s><ref target="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.004"/><s n="s11.13;p3.10">With the above question in mind, the inherent instability of the regime is definitely a point to consider, when evaluating the impact of 'charismatic authority' on the dictatorship. </s><s n="s12.13;p3.10">With the prospect of normalcy approaching as Germany emerged from the Great Depression, the Fuhrer had to act in his own interest: the entry into a long-drawn war would cement Hitler's status as the 'messiah' of the German population, and allow for the reign over the 'thousand-year Reich'. </s><s n="s13.13;p3.10">This apparent inevitability of war if the Nazi's were to stay in power was risk-taking (and in some aspects, miscalculation) on the part of Hitler and his cronies, because the fate of the party was now tied up with the outcome of the war. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.003"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.2;pn1.1">Max Weber, <hi rend="italic">Economy and Society</hi>, ed. </s><s n="s2.2;pn1.1">G Roth and C.

Germany formed a complex mosaic of party and state agencies with ill-defined and over-lapping jurisdictions, sometimes complementing each other, more often mutually antagonistic, all striving to obtain a monopoly of power in their own domain." </s><ref target="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.005"/><s n="s2.6;p4.10">This polycractic and inefficient structure, whereby the duplication of jobs, confusion amongst the various ministries, and internal rivalry to gain the backing of the Fuhrer, can be said to have undermined the political system in Germany. </s><s n="s3.6;p4.10">As Carr pointed out 'Confusion about the direction of policy was not restricted to the immediate circle around the Fuhrer. </s><s n="s4.6;p4.10">The whole structure of government has been aptly dubbed "authoritarian anarchy"." </s><ref target="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.006"/><s n="s5.6;p4.10">Also, as Ian Kershaw observed 'the demise of collective centralised government (the Cabinet never met again after 1938) promoted the disintegration of government into a proliferation of departments with ministries working largely independently of each other." </s><ref target="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.007"/><s n="s6.6;p4.10">Should the confusion be seen as the necessary and inevitable outcome of Hitler's 'charismatic rule' hence weakening the system from within; or can it be, that this was a deliberate policy of Hitler to encourage '...confusion and uncertainty as a means of consolidating his power'<ref target="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.008"/>, thus the implication that a strong and omnipotent dictator would unite the will of Germany within himself, making the Third Reich stronger as a personal (rather than party) dictatorship, because the power struggle at the bottom would not be able to penetrate the office held by the Fuhrer.

Fuhrer authority was more important than the direct governing will of the person Hitler'<ref target="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.009"/>, and to a large extent it is true, because the presence of the Fuhrer was largely absent in the day-to-day running of the government. </s><s n="s3.8;p5.10">For his part, Hitler encouraged Social Darwinism within the party and state, allowing competing interests to fight it out amongst themselves, through which, a victor emerges, or a consensus is reached, which would then have the backing of the Fuhrer. </s><s n="s4.8;p5.10">This laissez-faire attitude seemed to have compromised the standing of the Fuhrer on the affairs of the state, which is reinforced by records telling of Hitler's laid-back attitude to work. </s><s n="s5.8;p5.10">However, to conclude that Hitler was a weak dictator and that this in turn affected the standing of the Third Reich as a dictatorship would be unjustified. </s><s n="s6.8;p5.10">Though Hitler took a very long time to act, 'but when he did, his personal orders, or <hi rend="italic">Fuhrererlasse</hi>, cut quickly through the red-tape and ensured compliance with his decisions at least on major matters of policy and within the limits of available resources." </s><ref target="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.010"/><s n="s7.8;p5.10">Despite the apparent success of this policy of Social Darwinism, it must be noted that this system 'led

perhaps one of the inherent weaknesses, as well as strengths of a dictatorship. </s><s n="s2.10;p6.10">The centrality of the figure of Hitler in rallying the party together cannot be over-emphasised. </s><s n="s3.10;p6.10">Hitler's personal magnetism provided the foundations of charismatic authority within his own entourage and bonded the party leadership to him. </s><s n="s4.10;p6.10">It was as Kershaw described "personal conflicts within the Nazi elite which otherwise would have torn the system apart, were resolved only in Hitler's charismatic authority-in his indisputable position as the base of Nazism's popular legitimacy and the embodiment of Nazism's 'idea'." </s><ref target="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.012"/><s n="s5.10;p6.10">It is interesting to note that even though vicious rivalry and power struggles were prevalent within the Nazi party, none of it was aimed at toppling Hitler. </s><s n="s6.10;p6.10">And contrary to Stalin's fear of being overthrown, which manifested itself in the purges (Gulags), there was only one purge that Hitler agreed to, and even so, reluctantly-the purging of Ernst Rohm. </s><s n="s7.10;p6.10">It must be emphasised that Nazi dictatorship of the Third Reich would not have been possible without Hitler, because the mandate of the people resided in him, and not in the party. </s><s n="s8.10;p6.10">The man remained ever popular, despite the party's decline in popularity, owing to some unfavourable economic policies. </s><s n="s9.10;p6.10">This would however be interpreted as a strength to some extent, because the party could borrow Hitler's name to gain the much needed power for rule, but yet at the same time, the over-reliance on one man makes it virtually impossible to appoint an heir to replace Hitler as Fuhrer. </s><s

considered. </s><s n="s2.6;p7.10">Perhaps it would be logical to suggest that because of his immense popularity, those who resisted him were few. </s><s n="s3.6;p7.10">Few it seem, could contend with Hitler's deification and cult-like status, to the point that Hitler seemed to a large portion of the population as Germany's 'messiah'. </s><s n="s4.6;p7.10">However, this 'Hitler-worship' could have created a backlash against Hitler amongst the devout Christian/Catholic groups. </s><s n="s5.6;p7.10">More importantly, the lack of resistance from the traditional elites was in part, the result of Hitler's charismatic rule, which reduced the Army officers from 'power' elites to merely 'functional' elites, thus ensuring that countering and overthrowing Nazi rule would be extremely difficult to do accomplish, even if the Army had the will to do so. </s><s n="s6.6;p7.10">Therefore, it was due to the charisma and will of Hitler, that the traditional elites were unable to use him as a puppet for their own purposes. </s></p><p n="p8.10"><s n="s1.4;p8.10">However, charisma alone was inadequate to secure the support of the German population for the Third Reich. </s><s n="s2.4;p8.10">Like all other dictatorships, the element of terror was crucial in taming the obstinate 'enemies of the state.' </s><s n="s3.4;p8.10">The 'Hitler myth' and terror were therefore two sides of the same coin, 'ensuring political control and mobilisation behind the regime. </s><s n="s4.4;p8.10">It is no coincidence that terroristic repression escalated visibly in the final phrase of the waning regime as the binding force of Hitler's popularity weakened and collapsed.'<ref target="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.013"/> </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.013"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Kershaw, <hi

favourable, and the success that was much desired was obtained. </s><s n="s2.5;p9.10">Entry into World War II was inevitable for the survival of the system that inherently thrived on dynamism and periods of emergency, but it was a double-edged sword, in that failure of the war effort would surely bring the Nazi dictatorship to its knees, and it did. </s><s n="s3.5;p9.10">As the war started going badly, 'the tide of Hitler's popularity first waned rather slowly, then ebbed sharply-a decline accelerating after Stalingrad, when Hitler's personal responsibility for the catastrophe was widely recognised." </s><ref target="BAWE_0019i-ftnote.014"/><s n="s4.5;p9.10">Even the tool of propaganda could not erase the fallibility of the Fuhrer in the eyes of the people, instead, it made the population even more distrustful of the system that they had come to doubt. </s><s n="s5.5;p9.10">Therefore, the writer would conclude that ultimately, Hitler's 'charismatic rule' weakened the Third
