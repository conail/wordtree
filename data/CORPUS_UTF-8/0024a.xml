Doll's House'. </s><s n="s2.2;p1.29">However, before attacking the elements of this play that qualify it as an example of naturalism, I feel the need to explore this term further, in order to form a central understanding of what 'naturalism' refers to. </s></p><p n="p2.29"><s n="s1.2;p2.29">At its most basic level, naturalism may be defined as a movement in drama at the end of the nineteenth century calling for an end to romanticism and advocating a new type of realistic drama that would reflect social and scientific developments. </s><s n="s2.2;p2.29">Understanding the characteristics of naturalism on stage, however, is a rather more complex. </s></p><p n="p3.29"><s n="s1.8;p3.29">The idea that became the catalyst for the development was that of the scientific method as the key to all truth and progress, a belief grounded partly in Charles Darwin's 'The Origin of Species', and firmly rooted in the works of Emile Zola, the leader of the naturalist movement. </s><s n="s2.8;p3.29">Developing Darwin's argument that, "...human behaviour, when viewed as a product of hereditary and environmental forces, came to seem determined by factors largely beyond any individual's control',<ref target="BAWE_0024a-ftnote.001"/> Zola thought that the dramatists search for truth should be achieved using the same method of detachment as a scientist, "While I was busy writing Therese Raquin I gave myself up entirely to precise analysis of the human being... </s><s n="s3.8;p3.29">I wrote every scene, even the most impassioned, with scientific curiosity alone." </s><ref target="BAWE_0024a-ftnote.002"/><s n="s4.8;p3.29">Zola's much criticised scientific analysis in the novel, (it prompted one journalist to refer to it as "putrid literature") conforms entirely with the technique of the naturalist playwright to present on the stage a 'slice of life' in its most random and depressing form. </s><s n="s5.8;p3.29">In presenting truth on the stage, drama became brutally realistic and the typically happy endings of melodrama were erased. </s><s n="s6.8;p3.29">The shocking conclusion of 'A Doll's House', for example, was found to be unacceptable by many German audiences and Ibsen was forced to create a revised ending in which Nora finds herself unable to leave her children. </s><s n="s7.8;p3.29">Ibsen regarded this as a "barbaric violence done to the play.

the movement as a whole, they are each defined differently as a single play can be both naturalistic and realistic, "...it would be logical to us "Naturalism" to refer to the theoretical basis shared
