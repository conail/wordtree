deleted: collection of planning notes:
The use of the private langue argument can only work on sense data which is totaly private; the individual, personal imidge or feeling that forms in the mind when sense data or any sort of experience occers. This is assumeing that indeirect realist aprouch to perception, that what we experience is something private in our own minds an only caused by the outside world. I full accept that if a direct realist aprouch is taken
I am assumeing here an indirect realist aprouch to the idea of sense perception. I fully acknoladge that there is a strong case in - HOLD ON! ASK GLORIA AGAIN, SURELY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER A DIRECT OR INDIRECT REALISEM IS ASSUMED; PRIVATE INTROSPECTION IS JUST THAT, PRIVATE)
Things I need to find out so far
*	Whether my argument for individual inteliablity ? meeningull works
*	A quote from Descartes saying that the mind is a substance
1.	Descartes belives that the body and the soul are two distinct things
2.	Distinct things have unique properts and attributes
3.	Descartes belives that the soul has certain attributes: It exists. It lasts over time. It is non corporal. It is Indivisible. There is no way to come to know it via sense data (Quote: the rejecition of fire or mist idea of mind).
4.	For something to be tenable it must be meaningful
5.	One of the conditions for an existing thing (not a concept) being meaningful is that it is indivdualy intelligible
6.	 Individuality in existing things (not consepts, like numbers) can only be via it's special/temporal loctation, and this can only be arrived at via sense perception/data(the private langage argument only works against sense data which is private, not against the objects/source of sense perception which direct realists would claim is shared) (conditions for indivituation something: (applies only for indirect realist)
7.	Sense data from introspection must be discounted due to the private language argument, unless a second party is always present, even in our thoughts (God)
8.	God's existence cannot be assumed
9.	Descartes' 'mind' cannot be arrived at via acceptable sense data, so it cannot be individuated.
10.	Since it cannot be individuated it cannot be meaningful
11.	Since Descartes' 'mind' cannot be said to be meaningful his argument is untenable.

(MAKE CLEAR distinction between the object itself and the concept of it, between the mind and the concept of mind. Mentaion qualitative/quantative distionationality. We can only tell qunatavie distionction. Change boundery comment)
	 
Now usually we can distinquish between objects with our sense - two books look different, qualitative difference. How about if they identical? We could see they occupy different space and so must occupy different spacio/temporal lines and must be two distinct objects. But what can we do without senses...
Individual intellagliablity nessessary condiotin for meeningfullness
*	We cannot know what something is unless we know what a single instance of that things is. If we couldn't know this we wouldn't know where that thing stopped and another began. If we didn't know that we couldn't know where that thing's 'boarders' or 'bounderys' are, we couldn't tell it apart from the things surrounding it. If we can't know what a single instance of something is then we would not be able to tell where that thing started or stopped, as such we could not know if it was there or not. If something by it's principle cannot be known to be there or not then it is meaningless; it points to nothing and implys nothing
*	If we want to use words like 'the' 
Private languadge argument applied to introspective definitions.
*	Private introspection does not satisfy one of the nessesarty conditions of meaning.
*	The results of private introspection can be known only to you.
*	For a concept to be meeningfull is must have correctness condtions - you must know when you have experienced what you call the feeling of I and when you haven't. there must be some constraint to when I can say I have felt this feeling.
*	Since meening is normative, for us to be able to say 'I have the feeling of this being one mind and not ten' we have to have something to calibrate this sentence against, something which will tell us whether we were right or wrong to say what we said.
*	But since it is totally private then my use of that sentence can't be calibrated aginast anyone else.
*	We would be radically free in what we were pointing to when we said 'I have a feeling of this being one mind and not ten'. You cannot impress onto yourself a binding connection to avoid radical freedom because there is no guarantee or check that I use it correctly in the future, that I remember the connection I tried to impress on myself between the feeling and the sentence. All we would know is that it seems like it is the same feeling. But if seems right and is right are the same then we are radically free.
*	For the concept of mind to be meeningfull then it must be knowable in the public arena, and that does not happen with the private ostensive proof given by pointing inside and saying 'this is how I know there is only one of me in here'
