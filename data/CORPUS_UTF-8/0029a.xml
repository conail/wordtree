a change that can be considered groundbreaking, which has never been experienced before, fundamentally altering the current situation. </s><s n="s2.5;p1.8">Therefore, it would be fair to argue that there were many things that were revolutionary about the French Revolution which occurred in 1789 that included not just legal and political changes, introduced for the first time in French society, totally reforming it, but also a whole new way of thinking that was influential in causing the Revolution and implementing these changes in the first place. </s><s n="s3.5;p1.8">These new ideas first came about during the middle of the eighteenth-century during a period known as Enlightenment. </s><s n="s4.5;p1.8">This essay will attempt to outline the major revolutionary changes that occurred during the French Revolution. </s><s n="s5.5;p1.8">However, the general focus of the essay will be on the early years of the Revolution because it could be argued that the it lasted until 1815 with the fall of Napoleon and covering this whole period would be both unfeasible and lacking in depth for such a short essay. </s></p><p n="p2.8"><s n="s1.10;p2.8">Before analyzing what was revolutionary about the French Revolution, it is important to spend some time to examining France before this momentous event took place in order to provide a comparison between the two periods. </s><s n="s2.10;p2.8">Previously France had been an absolute monarchy with the King having enormous power. </s><s n="s3.10;p2.8">There was no constitution, and there were three very clear classes in society: at the top were the clergy; next came the aristocracy and finally the "Third Estate" (the rest of the population). </s><s n="s4.10;p2.8">The power lay with the first two groups and Andress describes France as 'a society of feudal aristocratic domination'<ref target="BAWE_0029a-ftnote.001"/> - the nobility (the clergy and aristocracy combined together) made up one percent of the population but owned twenty per cent of the land. </s><s n="s5.10;p2.8">The nobility also held many privileges such as exemption from tax or rights to special judicial treatment. </s><s n="s6.10;p2.8">Meanwhile, however, the lower classes were severely repressed. </s><s n="s7.10;p2.8">France was predominantly agricultural with twenty-four out of twenty-seven million of its population living in the countryside. </s><s n="s8.10;p2.8">There was a policy of high and variable taxation, but the "feudal" or "seigniurial" system produced even greater bitterness, as this meant peasants had to pay dues in addition to rent for the land. </s><s n="s9.10;p2.8">The taxation system was iniquitous 'With the most wealthy and powerful individuals and institutions (notably the Catholic Church) exempt from most taxes, and with more and more of the better-off buying into such privileges, the state had little choice to burden the poor'<ref target="BAWE_0029a-ftnote.002"/>. </s><s n="s10.10;p2.8">Ultimately the Bourbon monarchy failed to modernize society, which consequently led to problems for the government and eventually culminated in the French Revolution itself -
