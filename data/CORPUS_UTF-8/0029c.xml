one which was unavailable in Britain. </s><s n="s8.16;p2.6">That is, they were unlikely to be ultra-loyal to Britain anyway. </s><s n="s9.16;p2.6">Events which were unique to the colonies such as the Great Awakening also helped to foster a sense of common identity because Britain was not involved. </s><s n="s10.16;p2.6">Overall, whereas previously their situations had been similar, the life of the average American was now hugely different from the life of the average Englishman. </s><s n="s11.16;p2.6">It was certainly no co-incidence that at the same time the Americans were just beginning to form their own separate cultural identity from Britain, the British were exercising loose control over the colonies anyway - 'The preoccupation of Englishmen with their own affairs had resulted in general indifference to America and ignorance of her problems." </s><ref target="BAWE_0029c-ftnote.001"/><s n="s12.16;p2.6">This meant that the Americans already had a degree of semi-independence. </s><s n="s13.16;p2.6">This trend towards looser control had been increasing ever since the Glorious Revolution. </s><s n="s14.16;p2.6">The colonies also thought that because they had participated in the Glorious Revolution, they too deserved to share the rights which the Englishmen had been granted as the result of the Revolution in 1690 such as a liberal constitutional government. </s><s n="s15.16;p2.6">They saw themselves as equals to the British and not subordinates. </s><s n="s16.16;p2.6">Therefore, the fact that the Americans were gradually beginning to develop their own sense of identity, as well as the British exercising looser control over the colonies were the first step towards independence, but there was still a long way to go. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0029c-ftnote.001"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">1 Dora Mae Clark, <hi rend="italic">British Opinion and the American Revolution</hi> (New York, 1966), p. 2 </s></p></note><p n="p3.6"><s n="s1.21;p3.6">Another significant contribution to independence was the Seven Years' War and its effects. </s><s n="s2.21;p3.6">Britain was victorious in this war against Spain and France, which meant that there was no longer a common enemy to unite Britain and her colonies. </s><s n="s3.21;p3.6">America was now less dependent on Britain for protection against foreign powers. </s><s n="s4.21;p3.6">However, despite this, Britain still deployed armies in America to limit westward expansion. </s><s n="s5.21;p3.6">This greatly angered the colonists who hated the British interfering to such a great extent from overseas. </s><s n="s6.21;p3.6">The Americans did not appreciate the fact that the British were now trying to re-strengthen their hold over the colonies after years of indifference. </s><s n="s7.21;p3.6">The Seven Years' War also meant that Britain had a huge national debt which had doubled from £75 million to £150 million. </s><s n="s8.21;p3.6">The main reason why Britain had stationed an army to limit westward expansion was to prevent a greater expenditure on defence as protecting the current settlements from Native American attacks was already a costly task. </s><s n="s9.21;p3.6">In order to try to reduce the national debt, the British government attempted to tax the colonies to pay for their own administration and defence -
