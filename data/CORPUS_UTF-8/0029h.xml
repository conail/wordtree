Butlin estimates that disease halved the Aboriginal population between 1788 and 1850.<ref target="BAWE_0029h-ftnote.003"/> The single most destructive disease was smallpox because it was highly contagious and was able to spread extraordinarily quickly amongst an indigenous population which had very limited resistance. </s><s n="s8.13;p3.10">In the accounts of the Wellington Valley Mission there is also a great deal of evidence of sexually transmitted diseases. </s><s n="s9.13;p3.10">Watson states, 'The blacks here are inflicted with the venereal in a dreadful manner, children and even infants have it very commonly." </s><ref target="BAWE_0029h-ftnote.004"/><s n="s10.13;p3.10">This huge loss of Aboriginal population meant there were far fewer people to convert. </s><s n="s11.13;p3.10">Even within the time period of the Wellington Valley Mission it is apparent that there is a decreasing number of potential converts. </s><s n="s12.13;p3.10">Watson declares, 'We have lately had 70 natives here, now only about 20." </s><ref target="BAWE_0029h-ftnote.005"/><s n="s13.13;p3.10">However, it is important to note that this reduction in numbers may also have been caused by the other factors examined in this essay rather than explained purely by the deaths of Aborigines. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0029h-ftnote.003"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">N.G.

population. </s><s n="s2.6;p4.10">Indeed, the Aborigines were just as likely to follow the convicts as the missionaries due to the fact that benefits could also be gained from this group. </s><s n="s3.6;p4.10">Aboriginal men frequently compelled their females (both women and girls) to prostitute themselves against their will, 'because they themselves receive the wages of iniquity, being supported by the Europeans in such connexions'.<ref target="BAWE_0029h-ftnote.006"/> The missionaries, of course, strongly condemned this behaviour and Watson described the situation as the 'moral wretchedness with which we are surrounded'.<ref target="BAWE_0029h-ftnote.007"/> This, in turn, infuriated the convicts, some of whom 'have laboured hard to prevent the Blacks and their children from coming to me. </s><s n="s4.6;p4.10">There is a great spirit of Revenge manifested against me because I have opposed the abominable practice of living in adultery and fornication with Black women and Black girls'.<ref target="BAWE_0029h-ftnote.008"/> As with the issue of providing medicine to the Aborigines and convicts, which took time away from the teaching of Christianity, there was also a great deal of theft within the Wellington Valley Mission and Watson's 'time is very much taken up with secular matters for our servants being prisoners they are always on the alert to pilfer anything they can'.<ref target="BAWE_0029h-ftnote.009"/> The convicts encouraged the Aborigines to stray from the righteous path down which the missionaries were encouraging them. </s><s n="s5.6;p4.10">Some missionaries believed that 'true evangelism might proceed best in isolation from the temptations and distractions occasioned by the intrusion of the Europeans'.<ref target="BAWE_0029h-ftnote.010"/> This idea was put into practice with the institutions at Flinders Island and the Port Phillip Bay Reserve. </s><s n="s6.6;p4.10">However, the missionaries of Wellington Valley Mission did not, of
