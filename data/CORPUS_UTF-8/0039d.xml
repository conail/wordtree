Finkelstein indicates, it is one exemplification of how the Jewish community has utilised its previous anguish to deflect criticism of any of its current policies; such commemorations that have arisen since the Arab-Israeli war in 1967 constantly remind society of the dangers of anti-Semitism and as a result, have possibly 'been used to justify criminal policies of the Israel state and US support for these policies'<ref target="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.003"/>. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.003"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Finkelstein, <hi rend="italic">The Holocaust Industry</hi>, p.8. </s></p></note><p n="p3.8"><s n="s1.5;p3.8">However, Finkelstein's scepticism can be countered by the claim that Beth Shalom rather warns against any form of conflict than justify anymore, especially as it teaches about other persecuted minorities and its walls are covered with quotations emphasising the need for reconciliation and forgiveness. </s><s n="s2.5;p3.8">Indeed, the correct balance is attained by juxtaposing beautiful gardens with dark, musty corridors documenting the torturous past; the centre is not only a tribute to those who died, but a startling warning against further acts of barbarism. </s><s n="s3.5;p3.8">Significantly, it is a location 'where visitors from around the country and further field come to learn, to remember and to reflect'<ref target="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.004"/>; it does not provoke anger or pride for Jews, it succeeds in making visitors grateful for a peaceful present and yearn for a closure to inter-racial genocide. </s><s n="s4.5;p3.8">Another recently established commemoration, the Holocaust Memorial Day, achieves similar effects; it educates and aims to be inclusive, rather than produce antagonism and exclude. </s><s n="s5.5;p3.8">Without doubt, HMD drains people, it does not stir them: 'As both a means and an end, HMD aims to make the Holocaust relevant to as many people as possible and to help educate society about the causes and catastrophic effects'<ref target="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.005"/>. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.004"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">James M.Smith and Stephen D.

their underlying intention may actually be to glorify their triumph and capitalise on the theme of sacrifice for those who lost their lives for the "greater cause". </s><s n="s4.9;p4.8">Figure 2 shows the Thiepval Memorial on the Somme; the grand size, attractive architecture and inclusion of the French and British flags contribute to observers being inspired and moved, perhaps even longing to be part of such a spectacle. </s><s n="s5.9;p4.8">Focusing on British commemoration of the Great War, Fry has illustrated that in the 1920s, people became obsessed with making martyr's out of lost ones with national registers and records, alongside rolls of honour. </s><s n="s6.9;p4.8">Furthermore, 'the dead took on a sacred character'<ref target="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.006"/>; commemorative art was initially expressed in archaic language, comparing British soldiers with the valour of knights and kings, and stained glass windows proliferated in churches. </s><s n="s7.9;p4.8">For example, in St. Stephen's Church, Cheltenham, the saint's face was replaced with that of a soldier, complete with his moustache. </s><s n="s8.9;p4.8">All this added to the elevation of war, building men into champions of the victorious past. </s><s n="s9.9;p4.8">Even the literature of post-1918 concentrated on the theme of sacrifice as opposed to re-enforcing the horrors of war; hence, Siegfried Sassoon's <hi rend="italic">The Redeemer</hi> and Rudyard Kipling's <hi rend="italic">Gethsemane</hi>: 'It didn't pass- it didn't pass/ It didn't pass from me/ I drank it when we met the gas/ Beyond Gethsemane!'<ref target="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.007"/>. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.006"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Michelle Fry, 'Sacrifice Remembered: Memorials of the Great War and the Language of Remembrance', 2003, &lt;<seg type="URL" n="http://www.sassoonery.demon.co.uk/warmems.htm"/>> (2 May 2004) </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.007"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Rudyard Kipling, 'Gethsemane', 1914-1918, &lt;<seg type="URL" n="http://www.kipling.org.uk/kip-fra.htm"/>> (4 May 2004) </s></p></note><p n="p5.8"><s n="s1.8;p5.8">Chiefly, memorials are not always created to warn against war; sometimes they promote it. </s><s n="s2.8;p5.8">This depends heavily on whether those who construct memorials have won or lost. </s><s n="s3.8;p5.8">In addition, Fry argues that most memorials, whatever their original intention, actually result in celebrating and recalling the past, not preserving it. </s><s n="s4.8;p5.8">According to the psychologists Winter and Sivian, negative effects of symbols can only truly affect families, mainly through 'extrinsic contexts'<ref target="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.008"/> such as graves which bring back to life the pain experienced when losing a loved one. </s><s n="s5.8;p5.8">Therefore, if someone shares no direct bond with the dead, this including abstract relationships such as nationality or race, then memorials cannot negatively affect them and subsequently fashion them into loathing warfare. </s><s n="s6.8;p5.8">As the families die therefore, painful connotations fade; time steers this process, thus making it predetermined. </s><s n="s7.8;p5.8">In the end, people are influenced in positive ways: uniform headstones signify the common purpose and devotion of the soldiers- whatever their social class or rank- and the standard employment of the cross is a Christian motif 'evoking the infinite'<ref target="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.009"/>. </s><s n="s8.8;p5.8">As shown by figure 3, the memorials on the Somme for a twentieth-first century audience more than likely symbolise collective unity rather than individual loss. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.008"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Emmanuel Sivian and Jay Winter (eds.) <hi rend="italic">War and Remembrance in the Twentieth Century</hi> (Cambridge, 1999), p.38. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.009"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Michelle Fry, 'First World War Memorials and Cemeteries as symbolic landscapes in France and Belgium', 2003, &lt;<seg type="URL" n="http://www.sassoonery.demon.co.uk/symb-lscapel.htm"/>> (2 May 2004) </s></p></note><p n="p6.8"><s n="s1.9;p6.8">Vera Brittain extends this conception of time detaching people from the horrors of war, thereby leading the memorial to change its function from a representation of demise and misfortune to beauty and sacrifice: 'What a cheating and a camouflage was this combined effort of man and nature to create the impression that war was glorious just because its aftermath could wear an appearance of beauty and dignity'<ref target="BAWE_0039d-ftnote.010"/>. </s><s n="s2.9;p6.8">Geoff Dyer elaborates on this;
