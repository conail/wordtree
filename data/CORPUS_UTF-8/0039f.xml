seen as a severer crime as they did not have the inability, like men, to separate the powers of lust and love. </s><s n="s3.8;p3.18">This led to two situations; first, women had to endure the sexual

was absolutely servile to him. </s><s n="s7.8;p3.18">Fascinatingly, Sharpe also outlines that man's desire for a chaste wife forced women to be unblemished because they needed a husband to subsist, creating a situation where faithful wives remained eternally the property of one man. </s><s n="s8.8;p3.18">This leaves an assessment that women in pre-1700 marriages were utterly subservient to their

partnerships, the husband did not force his wife to be totally servile to his sexual or physical demands. </s><s n="s3.10;p4.18">Keith Thomas's supposition that women had to endure the sexual unfaithfulness of their husbands, for example, is countered by the unwillingness of an overwhelming quantity of men to indulge in adultery. </s><s n="s4.10;p4.18">Principally, this is because of religious teaching that infidelity was equally sinful for both sexes: 'Think not thy husband tied to this rule, O woman; nor thou thy wife tied, O husband, and the other free: the tie is equal'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.019"/>. </s><s n="s5.10;p4.18">Even if adultery was committed, the bulk of women from a lower socio-economic background were not pressurised to bear it because a viable option for them was abandonment<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.020"/>. </s><s n="s6.10;p4.18">They were less dependent on their husbands than ladies of the gentry as most earned a wage being charwomen, street sellers, laundresses, carters, street cleaners or prostitutes. </s><s n="s7.10;p4.18">Moreover, poorer women could easily commit infidelity themselves as, debatably, the poor had a more unconcerned attitude towards it: 'the tradition of promiscuity was...strong'<ref target="BAWE_0039f-ftnote.021"/>. </s><s n="s8.10;p4.18">Moreover, there were limits to the demands husbands could
