meant 'that since they are both feebler both in mind and in body, it is not surprising that they should come more under the spell of witchcraft'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.016"/> Especially pertinent for the actual crime of witchcraft was the notion that 'all witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which in women is insatiable'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.017"/> This was because 'it was

would have been no such cases and so it is important to understand why they arose. </s><s n="s8.15;p15.17">As already discussed, during the early sixteenth century witchcraft was tried more often as a crime of heresy and therefore there were a greater number of men prosecuted.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.090"/> However, this figure did decline over the period with diabolism becoming central to

Margaret Dale was accused of being a witch when it was found out that she no longer lived with her husband. </s><s n="s7.10;p16.17">The problem with witchcraft was that '...vaguely defined legal provisions against witchcraft gave an unprecedented power to all members of the community to solve their conflicts and to take revenge for anything'.<ref target="BAWE_0040b-ftnote.098"/> It is possible therefore that such accusations were used by a patriarchal society as a means of controlling women, but it also means that witchcraft could be used to solve all kinds of other issues, such as
