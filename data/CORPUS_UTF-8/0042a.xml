technology, much of the recent research by Andre Gunder Frank and Kenneth Pomeranz has proved beyond reasonable doubt that Asian economies were equal, if not ahead of Europe, sustaining great

from the Scientific Revolution, yet that did not arise in a void. </s><s n="s8.8;p5.8">It was due to Europe's failure to compete with Asia, as evident through the connections that led to the urge for innovating further; two, once Europe <hi rend="italic">did</hi> modernise its production techniques to match Asia's, the diffusion of that knowledge itself to Asia was successfully prevented by colonisation and de-industrialisation, whereby Asian economies were systematically ripped apart of all their great manufacturing hubs.<ref target="BAWE_0042a-ftnote.014"/> Thus, the nature of
