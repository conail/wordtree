unemployment rates of the 'Big Four', France, Italy, Germany and Spain, are too high. </s><s n="s6.7;p1.21">Most other European countries have been able to recover from the 1980's unemployment crises but mainly the 'Big Four' has failed to do so. </s><s n="s7.7;p1.21">Following arguments will explain some of the reasons why the 'Big Four' was not able to recover from 1980's unemployment disaster. </s></p><p n="p2.21"><s n="s1.4;p2.21">An increase in unemployment might have been caused by greater monopoly power between firms and workers. </s><s n="s2.4;p2.21">Greater monopoly power of employers, firms, will tend to increase prices, decrease output and set a lower employment with low wages. </s><s n="s3.4;p2.21">When unions have little power and there is high level of unemployment, the unions accept low real wages at any real wage rate. </s><s n="s4.4;p2.21">Therefore, less competitive product markets lead to higher unemployment (See Figure 1.1)<ref

there are some markets where the wages are determined between employers and trade unions, as a result firms and unions can determine an equilibrium real wage level. </s><s n="s2.4;p3.21">The overall wage depends on the strength of the trade unions; wage bargains, union coverage and the degree of co-ordination of wage bargains. </s><s n="s3.4;p3.21">Normally, the greater union power and coverage, the higher their wage demands will be (See Figure 1.2 and Figure 1.3)¹. </s><s n="s4.4;p3.21">However, this also leads to higher unemployment. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_0055c-fig.003"><head

because of the number of membership and strong union rights that pressure the institutions, industries and firms that put high real wages. </s></p><p n="p5.21"><s n="s1.7;p5.21">The government also effects the monopoly of labor unions with the laws and benefits they provide to the unemployed. </s><s n="s2.7;p5.21">The unemployment benefit is a very important factor which effects unemployment. </s><s n="s3.7;p5.21">When the unemployment benefits are high, their coverage are high and due long periods of times, which decreases the opportunity cost of not having a job. </s><s n="s4.7;p5.21">In other words, there is a lower possibility of an unemployed to fill vacancies in a market. </s><s n="s5.7;p5.21">The unemployed will look for a suitable job for himself until he finds one whereas if the unemployment benefits weren't so high, the unemployed would be willing to accept any job at any real wage rate. </s><s n="s6.7;p5.21">This might be one of the reasons why although the level of vacancy in Europe in the 1990's was high and yet the unemployment doubled in the last two decades (See Table 1.1)<ref target="BAWE_0055c-ftnote.002"/>. </s><s n="s7.7;p5.21">Whereas usually when there

willing to change their habitat for better job opportunities. </s><s n="s3.3;p11.21">Therefore, this also means that there will be less competition between workers to fill a vacancy, which as mentioned above, creates more unemployment. </s></p><p n="p12.21"><s n="s1.6;p12.21">Taxes also have a big influence on the level of unemployment. </s><s n="s2.6;p12.21">Mainly, three tax rates influence the gap between the producer and consumer real wage: payroll taxes(taxes that either the employer or employee pay and that are normally related to social security contributions), income taxes and consumer price taxes <ref target="BAWE_0055c-ftnote.004"/> In Figure 1.2 These tax wedges (the gap between what the sellers receive for supplying goods and services and the prices buyers buy) shifts the wage setting curve further to the right and thus increase the natural rate of unemployment. </s><s n="s3.6;p12.21">The reason why the wage setting curve shifts right is because the higher the taxes are, the greater the unions seek to provide a given real standard of living for their members and increase real wages. </s><s n="s4.6;p12.21">Tax wedges are also sought as a reason to understand some of the reasons for higher unemployment during the 1960-1985 period.<ref target="BAWE_0055c-ftnote.005"/> All countries, including the Big Four portray an increase in tax wedge, during the 1960's to 1990's. </s><s n="s5.6;p12.21">In contrast with the Big Four, countries such as Netherlands and UK has shown significant attempts to reduce labor taxes in recent years. </s><s

to correlate much with the rate of unemployment but still is a factor worth considering. </s><s n="s2.2;p17.21">They are the employment protection legislation (EPL) that the governments take to protect those in employment, e.g. formal dismissal practices, severance pay, formal notice periods of dismissal, the number of warning firms have to give a worker before he or she can be fired and so
