signalling pathways and encoding into a pattern of nerve impulses. </s></p><p n="p4.41"><s n="s1.4;p4.41">Stimuli can be of mechanical, visual or chemical nature. </s><s n="s2.4;p4.41">Acoustic sensations as well as those of touch and heat rely on the activity of mechanoreceptors, which are mostly ion channels of some sort. </s><s n="s3.4;p4.41">In contrast to that, vision and olfaction are achieved by detection of photons and odourants, respectively, which act as ligands on receptors that are coupled to G proteins. </s><s n="s4.4;p4.41">The ultimate goal of generating a nerve impulse, to be perceived and interpreted by specialised areas of the central nervous system is the common task of all sensory cells, which otherwise are very distinct from one another on the structural level. </s></p><p n="p5.41"><s n="s1.2;p5.41">All sensory systems function differently, yet there are a lot of similarities as well. </s><s n="s2.2;p5.41">It is difficult to establish comparisons on all aspects alike sheer due to the complexity and specificity of the cell signalling pathways involved, thus comparison has to be limited to some of the most obvious characteristics of sensory perception. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined">Touch and Temperature going hand in hand</head><p n="p6.41"><s n="s1.6;p6.41">Cutaneous touch and temperature perception are two senses that have quite a lot in common. </s><s n="s2.6;p6.41">Touch and temperature are detected by receptors, which are primarily found in specialised epidermal cells e.g. </s><s n="s3.6;p6.41">Merkel cells for touch or specialised nerve cells called nociceptors. </s><s n="s4.6;p6.41">As there is generally no ligand involved in touch perception or temperature perception, unless the skin is suspected to irritant chemicals or acid, the identification of mechanically sensitive receptors by ligand or toxin binding is not possible. </s><s n="s5.6;p6.41">Thus the detailed molecular compositions of mechanically activated proteins and the exact ways of activation remain unclear. </s><s n="s6.6;p6.41">But in either way, the response to touch or temperature does cause activation of mechanically gated ion channels and change of ion concentrations within the cell, which in turn cause the cellular membrane potential to change, therefore generating an action potential and ultimately resulting in a nerve impulse. </s></p><p n="p7.41"><s n="s1.3;p7.41">The types of proteins most intimately involved in somatosensational processes belong to the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family. </s><s n="s2.3;p7.41">Up to now, 28 genes in six subfamilies have been classified as TRP channels in humans. </s><s n="s3.3;p7.41">These channels are largely non-selective and classified by their primary amino acid sequence or structure, which commonly entails a certain number of ankyrin repeats, five transmembrane helices and a membrane pore, rather than their properties or selectivity, due to their diversity.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> </s></p><p n="p8.41"><s n="s1.3;p8.41">A model protein for TRP channels is the vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) as it is the only one so far that could be isolated and characterised on the basis of its ability to bind a ligand, in this case capsaicin, the molecule responsible for the hot taste of spicy food. </s><s n="s2.3;p8.41">Among many other nerve cells, TRPV1 is expressed in nociceptors of the skin, which appear to increase their cytosolic concentration of Ca <hi rend="sup">2+</hi> and Na+ ions in response to several stimuli. </s><s n="s3.3;p8.41">One is obviously capsaicin, which activates TRPV1 at a concentration as low as 1 M, as well as substances with a pH below 6 and temperatures above 40-42 °C. Interestingly, the presence of one of these factors intensifies the response to another e.g. the reaction to heat is greater at lower pH, maybe because these conditions are associated with cell injury and infection.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> </s></p><p n="p9.41"><s n="s1.2;p9.41">It is not certain how exactly touch in form of pressure or stretching can activate touch sensitive receptors. </s><s n="s2.2;p9.41">However, mutations of <hi rend="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</hi> elucidated that genes encoding microtubule subunits, membrane-associated structural proteins, and collagen are essential for touch sensitivity, thus this set of proteins could play a role in conveying force to a channel from each side of the membrane.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> </s></p><p n="p10.41"><s n="s1.4;p10.41">On the other hand, activation by temperature might be attributed to conformational changes of the channel, since essentially all proteins are temperature sensitive. </s><s n="s2.4;p10.41">But there are several TRP channels with unusually high temperature sensitivity, which can be found preferably in pain and temperature sensing neurons of the skin. </s><s n="s3.4;p10.41">Besides TRPV1, TRPV2 is thought to be susceptible to noxious heat above 50 °C while TRPV3 and 4 are activated by temperatures from 22-40 °C. Temperatures below 22 °C on the other hand, activate TRPM8. </s><s n="s4.4;p10.41">There is little selectivity for ions, but especially Ca <hi rend="sup">2+</hi> permeability is markedly increased

relies on mechanical transduction is hearing. </s><s n="s2.5;p11.41">The mechanisms involved in the detection of sound waves, however, are far better understood than the detection of other mechanical stimuli. </s><s n="s3.5;p11.41">And in contrast to the several different touch or temperature sensing cells with their vast number of receptors, only one type of specialised epidermal cells exists in the cochlea of the human ear, namely the hair cell. </s><s n="s4.5;p11.41">This is not to say that there are no other cells involved, but hair cells are the primary sensory cells with organelles that enable purely mechanical transduction. </s><s n="s5.5;p11.41">These organelles are stereocilia, tiny cylindrical, actin-filled rods of different lengths that emerge from the upper cellular surface in a hexagonal array. </s></p><p n="p12.41"><s n="s1.7;p12.41">A sound wave entering the cochlea sets the stereocilia in motion, causing them to slide along one another and exert pressure on tip links, which are fine filaments connecting the stereocilia. </s><s n="s2.7;p12.41">Tip links are thought to be directly connected to Ca <hi rend="sup">2+</hi> ion channels, which will open or close, depending on the direction of the movement. </s><s n="s3.7;p12.41">Influx of Ca <hi rend="sup">2+</hi> ions causes opening of Ca <hi rend="sup">2+</hi> gated K+ ion channels and subsequently depolarisation of the membrane, thus the generation of an action potential. </s><s n="s4.7;p12.41">Changes in potential release a neurotransmitter from the basolateral surface of the cell to synapses connecting to the auditory nerve. </s><s n="s5.7;p12.41">The resulting postsynaptic signal leads to a nerve impulse, which is then transmitted to the brain. </s><s n="s6.7;p12.41">Rapid return to the resting potential is possible through K+ specific channels, which allow the ions to leave the cell. </s><s n="s7.7;p12.41">Hair cells that are tuned to higher frequencies express channels with smaller relaxation time constraints than cells tuned to lower frequencies, moreover, the number of K+ channels in a cell increases with the preferably detected frequency of this particular cell.4, 8 </s></p><p n="p13.41"><s n="s1.4;p13.41">Aside from being remarkably temporarily accurate and sensitive due to the lack of slow chemical processes and employing a direct mechanical approach for transduction, amplification of sound waves are another outstanding feature of auditory transduction. </s><s n="s2.4;p13.41">The proposed, and as of yet most likely, mechanism is thought to involve the hair bundle organelle. </s><s n="s3.4;p13.41">Unlike amplification of signals in visual transduction, which relies on the biochemical cascade taking place within rods or cones, it is the cell organelle itself that enhances vibrations caused by sound waves. </s><s n="s4.4;p13.41">And stereocilia may even vibrate in the absence of exterior stimuli, which seems as unlikely as the emission of photons by rods and cones, or the production of odourants by olfactory receptor cells.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined">GPCRs unite light and

gene family by far. </s><s n="s3.4;p15.41">The first member of the olfactory receptor family in humans was cloned and identified in 1999. </s><s n="s4.4;p15.41">Meanwhile, a complete gene cluster

mostly found in the fovea centralis of the human retina, and do not have such highly specialised cellular structures, since the major role of their three different types of rhodopsin is to enable colour vision at high light levels instead of sensitivity to low levels of light. </s></p><p n="p18.41"><s n="s1.6;p18.41">Olfactory receptors, on the other hand, are expressed in cilia projecting from millions of sensory neurons located in the main olfactory epithelium. </s><s n="s2.6;p18.41">Only one kind of receptor is expressed per cell but it is as of yet unclear how expression is regulated. </s><s n="s3.6;p18.41">The axon of each odorant receptor is targeted to a particular point in the olfactory bulb, such that all cells expressing the same receptor synapse with one set of interneurons, patched together in glomeruli. </s><s n="s4.6;p18.41">The pattern of electric activity in the olfactory bulb reflects which receptors have been stimulated and is therefore unique for every odourant since each odourant activates a certain number of specific receptors to a different extent. </s><s n="s5.6;p18.41">Also, most receptors are activated by more than one odourant. </s><s n="s6.6;p18.41">This enables the human olfactory system to detect about 10000 odourants, although there are only 350 receptors, at remarkably low concentrations and with high specificity - it can, for
