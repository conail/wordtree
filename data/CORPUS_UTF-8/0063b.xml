French. </s><s n="s3.5;p1.8">This was the first piece of vernacular history in French, predating the earliest Anglo-Norman texts by two decades, and continental French texts by a century.<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.001"/> It celebrates the crusaders' victory at Antioch in 1098, which was of great significance as it gave the crusaders a foothold into the Holy Lands and they then went on to conquer Jerusalem. </s><s n="s4.5;p1.8">History writing in the Middle Ages was often a combination of literature and history, so the reliability of such sources is questionable. </s><s n="s5.5;p1.8">The <hi rend="italic">Canso d'Antioca</hi> is described as an epic chronicle; although there is undoubtedly some accuracy in his account, there is a propagandist element to it also.

n="s2.11;p2.8">Bechada was also advised to write this account by Gaubert the Norman. </s><s n="s3.11;p2.8">This may have influenced the writing as Bechada had to take their views into consideration, but it also gives the work added authority. </s><s n="s4.11;p2.8">His account could not solely have been his opinions or perceptions. </s><s n="s5.11;p2.8">Bechada was anxious about the use of the vernacular. </s><s n="s6.11;p2.8">Despite knowledge of Latin, which was considered the authoritative language, Bechada chose to write in Occitan 'so that the populace might fully comprehend it'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.002"/>, which was the same reason for writing in popular metre. </s><s n="s7.11;p2.8">Thus Bechada is concerned with stressing the truth and reliability of his writing. </s><s n="s8.11;p2.8">As an epic chronicle, many literary descriptions and devices have been employed which may appear to limit the credibility of the writing. </s><s n="s9.11;p2.8">The <hi rend="italic">chansons de jest</hi> that were common in the Middle Ages drew on historical events to highlight social and political aspects of the day. </s><s n="s10.11;p2.8">It is clear also that Bechada produced propaganda for the crusades, to encourage participation and support for it. </s><s n="s11.11;p2.8">Yet despite all these things, the Occitan fragments of the <hi rend="italic">Canso d'Antioca</hi> can still be considered as history as there is truth in his words and they do give a description of a famous incident during the First Crusade. </s></p><note place="foot"

</s><s n="s4.17;p3.8">Although it is subtle, as it is not the main focus of the passage, it would influence the audience into trusting in the song. </s><s n="s5.17;p3.8">The Occitan fragments actually begin with a conversation between the King of Persia, King Kerbogha and his 'courtly interpreter'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.004"/>, Herluin. </s><s n="s6.17;p3.8">This dialogue helps to convey the Turks response to the crusaders and the battle at Antioch, or at least the crusaders' view of what the Turks thought. </s><s n="s7.17;p3.8">It then moves on to very detailed descriptions of the battle and the individual combats. </s><s n="s8.17;p3.8">There is a clear propagandist message in the lists of names of the soldiers that partook in the battle. </s><s n="s9.17;p3.8">It is only the highest soldiers that are mentioned, possibly those that Bechada's patron had relations with, and they are described as, 'a courageous and bold group'<ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.005"/>. </s><s n="s10.17;p3.8">The King is portrayed as worried and anxious about the threat of the Christian army, so he seeks for consolation in Herluin. </s><s n="s11.17;p3.8">Herluin, however, far from relieving his fears, exacerbates them, by encouraging Kerbogha to flee, 'Noble king, why not turn and take flight?" </s><ref target="BAWE_0063b-ftnote.006"/><s n="s12.17;p3.8">The strength of the Christian army is emphasised to celebrate their victory and increase their prestige. </s><s n="s13.17;p3.8">It would also encourage others to join the crusaders as they would be impressed by the easy defeat of the Turks and by the fear the crusaders inspired. </s><s n="s14.17;p3.8">As the knights were depicted as heroes, others would want some of that glory too, and in this account they would have role models to follow. </s><s n="s15.17;p3.8">There are detailed descriptions of individual battles, commemorating certain soldiers, such as Duke Godfrey and Walter the German. </s><s n="s16.17;p3.8">Although epic chronicles did contain stock motifs, such as a set description of single combats, this could be seen as propaganda as Bechada chose to highlight certain men above others. </s><s
