decision must affect the applicant's rights or interests [10] As being excluded from school directly affects the applicants, this requirement is met. </s><s n="s3.4;p5.156">Given their age, it may be more realistic to consider the standing of their parents. </s><s n="s4.4;p5.156">Parents would be 'surrogate' representatives [11], an uncontroversial means of protecting the rights of those who cannot easily access the forum of judicial review. </s></p><p n="p6.156"><s n="s1.2;p6.156">The applicants would also satisfy the stricter 'victim' test for review under the Human Rights Act [12].

applicants are faced with the added difficulty that any perceived 'undue delay' in bringing the action may lead to the claim being struck out even if it is made within 3 months [16]. </s><s

n="s2.3;p10.156">Although justified to filter out frivolous claims [17], this can lead to a fusion of questions of standing with issues of merits [18], which might more appropriately be considered at a later stage. </s><s n="s3.3;p10.156">Again the discretionary nature of judicial decision-making makes it difficult to predict whether the applicants would be adjudged as having arguable cases, however, these are allegations of serious administrative errors based on well-structured grounds of review. </s></p><p n="p11.156"><s n="s1.3;p11.156">The question of an arguable case is also central to an application for interim relief [19]. </s><s n="s2.3;p11.156">This may be appropriate to the students, given that they would suffer a lack of schooling during the course of proceedings. </s><s

decisions in this case are easily reversible, the prerogative quashing order may be appropriate. </s><s n="s4.4;p12.156">Alternatively, they could seek a mandatory order of readmission [20], or, if X

of illegality and irrationality as well as procedural impropriety. </s><s n="s2.4;p16.156">In relation to procedural impropriety, 'fairness' is often used synonymously with 'natural justice' [21] when the decisions are made in an everyday administrative context such as this. </s><s n="s3.4;p16.156">The term is flexible [22]. </s><s n="s4.4;p16.156">In a broad sense it requires a balancing of the individual interests at stake, the benefits to be gained by following the correct procedure and the costs of complying. </s></p><p n="p17.156"><s n="s1.4;p17.156">The protection applies to decision-making which affects the rights and interests of individuals [23], therefore the panel's power to expel X, impacting on a very important interest [24], is subject to these rules. </s><s n="s2.4;p17.156">It remains to be considered whether the rules of fairness have been breached. </s><s n="s3.4;p17.156">In refusing to consider the medical report, it is arguable that X was denied a fair hearing. </s><s n="s4.4;p17.156">A duty to provide a hearing applies whenever an individual may suffer detriment as a result of a decision [25], and is most stringently applied where the sanction imposed would deprive a person of his livelihood [26] - a close analogy can be drawn with expulsion from school, which has long-term effects on education and career. </s></p><p n="p18.156"><s n="s1.2;p18.156">As the requirements of a fair hearing vary according to the circumstances [27], an oral hearing and strict rules of evidence may not apply [28] For reasons of time and cost, judicial review procedure places limits on the exploration of disputed factual matters. </s><s n="s2.2;p18.156">Therefore, X's broad entitlement to a hearing may not extend as far as the right to introduce the medical report. </s></p><p n="p19.156"><s n="s1.3;p19.156">On the other hand, given that the school's policy specifically provides for a hearing, this may engender a legitimate expectation of a protection going beyond the minimal requirement [29]. </s><s n="s2.3;p19.156">The statement of policy is clear [30], it is promised to only a few people [31], and compliance with it would not place too onerous a burden on the panel [32]. </s><s n="s3.3;p19.156">There may be grey areas in the doctrine of legitimate expectations [33], however, in general procedural expectations such as this one are most likely to be upheld. </s></p><p n="p20.156"><s n="s1.3;p20.156">The panel may, of course, argue that they did not fail to consider the medical report; rather, due to its apparent inconclusiveness, they simply decided not to attach such weight to it as to consider it in any detail. </s><s n="s2.3;p20.156">For the court to review the panel's discretionary judgment of the report would be to risk infringing the fundamental constitutional principle that 'judicial review is concerned with the decision-making process not the decision.' [34] X needs to take care to steer his action away from merits review, framing it in terms of natural justice [35] or error of law for wrongfully excluding evidence [36]. </s><s n="s3.3;p20.156">There is no room for judicial review to admit new evidence [37]. </s></p><p n="p21.156"><s n="s1.2;p21.156">Finally, the panel may contend that consideration of the report would have made no difference. </s><s n="s2.2;p21.156">Case law suggests that this is not an excuse [38], as the reviewing court is not is a position to work out whether hearing the evidence would have made any difference [39]; however, as remedies are discretionary, the court may refuse to grant one if the result would have been the same regardless of the breach of natural justice [40]. </s></p><p rend="ordered" n="p22.156"><s n="s1.1;p22.156">That the policy of automatic expulsion for a second positive test is irrational/ disproportionate. </s></p><p rend="ordered" n="p23.156"><s n="s1.3;p23.156">This is effectively asking the court to substitute its own view on the merits the policy for that of the school, something which they are reluctant to do both due to a lack of institutional competence to deal with polycentric issues [41] and concerns at the constitutional impropriety of interfering with political decision-making [42]. </s><s n="s2.3;p23.156">However, reviewing courts will show limited deference to a subordinate decision, such as that of the school. [43]. </s><s n="s3.3;p23.156">That the policy-maker in this case lacks direct democratic accountability further diminishes the degree of deference owed by the court [44]. </s></p><p n="p24.156"><s n="s1.5;p24.156">Administrative law increasingly considers substantive as well as procedural issues [45]. </s><s n="s2.5;p24.156">In relation to irrationality, the <hi rend="underlined">Wednesbury</hi> [46] unreasonableness test comes close to a merits review. </s><s n="s3.5;p24.156">The traditional Wednesbury test [47] was set so high that it would be of little assistance to X. The school could provide a rational justification for the policy, for example sending out a strict message of no-tolerance on drugs. </s><s n="s4.5;p24.156">Yet aside from the more stringent proportionality test [48], irrationality has evolved since Wednesbury: <hi rend="underlined">ex parte Smith</hi> [49] emphasises the need for a stricter standard of review when individual rights are concerned [50]. </s><s n="s5.5;p24.156">X's right to attend school is an important one; therefore the panel may find it difficult to justify a policy which automatically disregards this. </s></p><p n="p25.156"><s n="s1.6;p25.156">In a human rights context, proportionality rather than Wednesbury unreasonableness is the applicable test [51]. </s><s n="s2.6;p25.156">As a public body, the state school must act compatibly with Convention rights [52]. </s><s n="s3.6;p25.156">X's right to education [53] is presumptively protected. </s><s n="s4.6;p25.156">Proportionality considers whether the means used to achieve a legitimate goal infringe the individual's rights more than is necessary [54]. </s><s n="s5.6;p25.156">As in this case, clashing protective rights must be balanced against each other. </s><s n="s6.6;p25.156">Arguably it would be difficult to protect other pupils by a lesser measure, however, proportionality jurisprudence does not look favourably on blanket policies [55]. </s></p><p n="p26.156"><s n="s1.3;p26.156">Even if it is not deemed irrational, X may object to the policy under the overlapping ground of illegality. </s><s n="s2.3;p26.156">It is unlawful for an authority to fetter its discretion, which is the result of a rigid policy [56] which allows no exceptions [57] and precludes the decision-maker from taking relevant considerations into account [58]. </s><s n="s3.3;p26.156">On a second positive test, the school's policy of automatic expulsion is absolutely rigid, allowing for no exceptions to the sanction. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Y</head><p n="p27.156"><s n="s1.1;p27.156">Suspended for a term after a positive test for cannabis, Y alleges that the panel was biased because: </s></p><p rend="ordered" n="p28.156"><s n="s1.2;p28.156">Y had previously made a complaint about the behaviour of one of the teachers. </s><s n="s2.2;p28.156">Y can argue that </s></p><p rend="ordered" n="p29.156"><s n="s1.1;p29.156">this teacher would not provide her with a fair and impartial hearing. </s></p><p n="p30.156"><s n="s1.8;p30.156">There is no need to show actual victimisation [59]; appearance of bias is enough [60]. </s><s n="s2.8;p30.156"><hi rend="underlined">Porter v Magill</hi> [61] requires the reviewing court to consider whether, having regard to relevant circumstances, the fair-minded and impartial observer would consider that there was a 'real possibility' of bias. </s><s n="s3.8;p30.156">We would need to know more about the circumstances of the complaint and Y's relationship with this teacher. </s><s n="s4.8;p30.156">For example, how long ago was the complaint made?
