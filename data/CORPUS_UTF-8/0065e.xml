n="s6.7;p7.32">After a displaced fracture, there may be pain, tenderness, stiffness, loss of movement and usually swelling in the affected area. </s><s n="s7.7;p7.32">The anatomic location of the

(involving the ends of a long bone). </s></p><p n="p8.32"><s n="s1.5;p8.32">Fractures involving the tibia and fibula are the most common lower extremity paediatric fractures. </s><s n="s2.5;p8.32">The

amount of displacement, whether the adjacent joint surface is involved, or if the overlying muscle, fat and skin are disrupted, as in an open fracture. </s><s n="s2.4;p9.32">All of these facts help determine the best course of treatment. </s><s n="s3.4;p9.32">If a fracture extends into a joint, it must be carefully assessed with x-rays to determine if there is any significant change from the
