been rapid and have contributed to the increase in average life expectancy. </s><s n="s2.8;p1.9">There has also been an overall drop in mortality and morbidity rates within developed countries. </s><s n="s3.8;p1.9">On initial examination of this data, it would seem apparent that this trend is indeed advantageous to us and free of any dilemma. </s><s n="s4.8;p1.9">However, with further thought it has been shown that quite simply possessing the means to preserve life does not necessarily offer the patient the best option. </s><s n="s5.8;p1.9">It is quite possible now to keep a brain stem dead patient alive for many years. </s><s n="s6.8;p1.9">But this is neither beneficial nor humane for the patient concerned. </s><s n="s7.8;p1.9">The clinician, in this scenario, is prolonging life just because he has the capacity to and not because it is in the patients' best interests. </s><s n="s8.8;p1.9">Ethical arguments have therefore brought into contention the role of the clinician in these scenarios- are they prolonging life or are they prolonging the process of dying? </s></p><p n="p2.9"><s n="s1.7;p2.9">For some people 'life' is seen as intrinsically good and valuable and they feel it should be preserved at all costs. </s><s n="s2.7;p2.9">But for some people the quality of life takes precedence when trying to determine its value. </s><s n="s3.7;p2.9">Without quality, life loses its value and to preserve life over suffering does not seem worthwhile. </s><s n="s4.7;p2.9">As doctors we need to observe this assessment of 'quality' and when important decisions are made concerning life the psychological, spiritual and emotional aspects of a patient's life need to be considered. </s><s n="s5.7;p2.9">When administrating medications, it needs to be assessed whether the burden of treatments are unacceptably high for the patient and whether extending life would be in the patients best interest. </s><s n="s6.7;p2.9">Furthermore would the treatment offered provide a significant improvement or amelioration of the disease process? </s><s n="s7.7;p2.9">When making an informed decision, these questions have to be answered. </s></p><p n="p3.9"><s n="s1.14;p3.9">Recent events such as the 'Diane Pretty' case have shown that these questions are difficult to answer. </s><s n="s2.14;p3.9">They have bought to the forefront the argument of euthanasia. </s><s n="s3.14;p3.9">The word euthanasia derived from the Greek language means 'good death'. </s><s n="s4.14;p3.9">Euthanasia is performed either by undertaking acts that directly bring about death or failing to prevent death. </s><s n="s5.14;p3.9">The distinction between these creates two subgroups of euthanasia; the former is classed as active euthanasia and the latter as passive euthanasia. </s><s n="s6.14;p3.9">Draper, in 1998, defined euthanasia using three key points. </s><s n="s7.14;p3.9">He defined it as 'death resulting from the intention of a <hi rend="bold">single</hi> person to kill another using the most <hi rend="bold">gentle</hi> and easy means possible...motivated solely by the <hi rend="bold">best interest</hi> by the person who dies'. </s><s n="s8.14;p3.9">Within this definition the motive is set and it is this motive that differentiates euthanasia from murder or manslaughter. </s><s n="s9.14;p3.9">In events of 'physician assisted suicide', the patient kills himself/herself using methods provided by the doctor. </s><s n="s10.14;p3.9">This is often confused to be euthanasia - but it is imperatively not as in this case the doctor did not do the killing. </s><s n="s11.14;p3.9">There are other scenarios where practices that involve ending a patient's life may be classed as euthanasia for example, withdrawing or withholding treatment. </s><s n="s12.14;p3.9">If a patient refuses life-prolonging therapy, and their decision is voluntary, informed and made with a competent mind and is free of any doctor coercion, then it is not euthanasia. </s><s n="s13.14;p3.9">The doctor in this scenario is not intending to kill the patient but is simply complying with the wishes of the patient. </s><s n="s14.14;p3.9">To further clarify, a case for euthanasia must involve intentional killing of another person using gentle means motivated by the best interests of the patient. </s></p><p n="p4.9"><s n="s1.7;p4.9">The Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE) is based upon the deontological view that intentions and not consequences are the important aspect of moral behaviour. </s><s n="s2.7;p4.9">For example, a terminally ill patient in severe pain may be given diamorphine to alleviate the pain. </s><s n="s3.7;p4.9">The continuing use of diamorphine may as a secondary result induce respiratory failure and cause death. </s><s n="s4.7;p4.9">The doctor's intention however was to alleviate pain and he/she made a sound clinical decision to take precedence of suffering over prolonging life. </s><s n="s5.7;p4.9">If the doctor was to administer a fatal dose of potassium chloride then his decision would not have been based on pain relief and in this scenario the doctor would be in the wrong. </s><s n="s6.7;p4.9">A brief look at the DDE has shown that it is very difficult to assess what was intended and what was a fatal consequence. </s><s n="s7.7;p4.9">The DDE may be recognised in legal judgements but it is very difficult to apply in practice. </s></p><p n="p5.9"><s n="s1.6;p5.9">Currently active euthanasia is illegal in the United Kingdom. </s><s n="s2.6;p5.9">In December 1997, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg told the House of Lords 'euthanasia is a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life....the government is absolutely opposed to euthanasia in any form'. </s><s n="s3.6;p5.9">However as previously discussed a doctor may, with correct intentions, administer a large dose of pain relieving drugs to a terminally ill patient in order to suppress the pain whilst having the knowledge that this action may result in death. </s><s n="s4.6;p5.9">In the case of R versus Brodkin Adams (1957), the actions of the doctor in promoting comfort through lethal dose of analgesics in a stroke patient (which subsequently shortened the patient's life) was given the verdict of not guilty. </s><s n="s5.6;p5.9">The doctor was 'acting in the best interests of this patient.' </s><s n="s6.6;p5.9">Thus a doctor is entitled to do all that is necessary to relieve pain and suffering even if the measures undertaken may incidentally shorten life. </s></p><p n="p6.9"><s n="s1.9;p6.9">We have explored the complex nature of euthanasia and we shall now explore the pros and cons associated with it. </s><s n="s2.9;p6.9">Elements that favour euthanasia include <hi rend="italic">respect for autonomy.</hi> </s><s n="s3.9;p6.9">A competent patient has the right to dictate the timing and circumstances of their own death. </s><s n="s4.9;p6.9">Moreover a patient had the right to alleviate themselves from any pain and suffering. </s><s n="s5.9;p6.9">This right is contained within the Human Rights Act 1998. </s><s n="s6.9;p6.9">Beneficence and non-maleficence are principles that aim to seek maximum benefit and minimal harm. </s><s n="s7.9;p6.9">If a doctor refuses to alleviate a patient's suffering and unbearable pain then he/she is violating his/her primary obligation of beneficence and non-maleficence. </s><s n="s8.9;p6.9">Another ethical factor which is in favour of the euthanasia argument is that of justice. </s><s n="s9.9;p6.9">It is both ethically and legally accepted for a competent patient receiving treatment whether medical or surgical, to refuse treatment even though this would lead to their premature death. </s></p><p n="p7.9"><s n="s1.17;p7.9">The opposing arguments for euthanasia include: killing is unlawful and unjust in any scenario. </s><s n="s2.17;p7.9">Life is an intrinsic value and should be preserved at all times. </s><s n="s3.17;p7.9">Doctors have the ultimate goal of avoiding harm and loss of life. </s><s n="s4.17;p7.9">Under no circumstances should doctors go against this. </s><s n="s5.17;p7.9">The advancement of medicine in this era would suggest a patient's pain and suffering are controllable. </s><s n="s6.17;p7.9">For example in the case of administering diamorphine for pain relief; is this the only analgesic available for pain relief? </s><s n="s7.17;p7.9">The answer would be a sound no. </s><s n="s8.17;p7.9">There are alternative analgesics available that do not hold the lethal side effects. </s><s n="s9.17;p7.9">But in argument to this, does a patient really want to be pumped full of drugs in their last moments of life. </s><s n="s10.17;p7.9">If euthanasia was to be legalised then there is potential for burdened carers, family members and healthcare professionals to consider it as the first option rather than the last. </s><s n="s11.17;p7.9">The illegality of euthanasia protects it from being abused. </s><s n="s12.17;p7.9">There is also a possibility of physicians making mistakes. </s><s n="s13.17;p7.9">False diagnoses, prognoses, errors in treatment and assessment of pain can easily occur which would generate false candidates for euthanasia. </s><s n="s14.17;p7.9">Further, the regulatory processes for legal euthanasia would be too complex. </s><s n="s15.17;p7.9">The aspects of abuse of power can also be a problem if euthanasia was legalised. </s><s n="s16.17;p7.9">In the case of Harold Shipman it could be argued that he was acting in the best interest of his patients and was quite simply giving them a good, pain free death. </s><s n="s17.17;p7.9">This 'license for killing' can be potentially dangerous to introduce into clinical practice. </s></p><p n="p8.9"><s n="s1.9;p8.9">Whether we are for or against euthanasia, one thing is surely true- that the case of euthanasia needs to be discussed openly. </s><s n="s2.9;p8.9">Euthanasia occurs all the time. </s><s n="s3.9;p8.9">It is often behind closed doors and is done in a 'seedy' and often un-dignifying way. </s><s n="s4.9;p8.9">Simply because it is illegal regardless of whether the doctor was acting in the patients best interests, often gives the whole scenario a guilty and immoral feel. </s><s n="s5.9;p8.9">When scandals are released into the news and press, the doctor is always shown to have done something wrong. </s><s n="s6.9;p8.9">This maybe because the situation was kept quiet or because something 'illegal' was committed. </s><s n="s7.9;p8.9">These scenarios can also seem unlawful and wrong when people do not have enough information on the ethics and legality of euthanasia. </s><s n="s8.9;p8.9">Open debate can help solve this unawareness and uneasiness involved in euthanasia. </s><s n="s9.9;p8.9">Open debate could help illustrate that something that is illegal is not necessarily wrong. </s></p><p n="p9.9"><s n="s1.4;p9.9">As future doctors it is our right to bring these issues into light. </s><s n="s2.4;p9.9">We should promote open debate and insist that the GMC and other related bodies give their full backing and support when bringing these issues to parliament. </s><s n="s3.4;p9.9">A doctor, in my opinion, is negating his promise of acting in the best of interests of his patients if he/she refuses to discuss these matters. </s><s n="s4.4;p9.9">An informed opinion is vital if care of the highest standard is to be delivered. </s></p></div1></body><back/></text></TEI.2>
