requiring the same set of institutions - will occur simultaneously. </s><s n="s3.5;p1.5">Olson's theory may provide an explanation for why the Chinese economy under Qing rule (1644-1912) experienced no intensive growth at all, whilst per capita income during the same period in Western Europe more than quadrupled. </s><ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.003"/><s n="s4.5;p1.5">This essay will outline the key features of Olson's argument in the context of China and Western Europe at this time. </s><s n="s5.5;p1.5">By contrasting the gradual emergence of democracy in Europe after the fall of medieval feudalism with the "autocratic" bureaucracy prevailing in China throughout the Qing dynasty, it will be argued that Olson's theory is indeed applicable, yet not sufficient, for explaining the contrasting economic experiences of China and Western Europe since the late Middle Ages. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.001"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Olson, 567. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.002"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid, 567. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.003"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Maddison, 42. </s></p></note><p n="p2.5"><s n="s1.7;p2.5">In the spirit of Hobbes<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.004"/>, Olson claims that "no society can work satisfactorily if it does not have a peaceful order"<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.005"/> and pictures a state of "roving banditry" where recurrent plundering eliminates every incentive to produce above subsistence level. </s><s n="s2.7;p2.5">He argues that, due to this, any human society of considerable size will be seized by a self-interested, rational autocrat - a "stationary bandit" - which "monopolizes theft ... through regular taxation"<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.006"/> and protects his victims from the occasional theft of roving bandits.<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.007"/> In effect, this is Olson's model of autocracy, the system of rule he claims has dominated human societies at least up to the eighteenth century.<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.008"/> According to Olson, the "autocratic ruler has an incentive to extract the maximum possible surplus from the whole society and use it for his own purposes"<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.009"/>. </s><s n="s3.7;p2.5">Thus, it will be in the autocrat's interest to provide public goods, such as military protection, if the returns from such investments, in the form of increased tax revenues following the increase in market income, more than cover the cost of providing the good itself. </s><s n="s4.7;p2.5">Under Qing rule, the Chinese empire was technically a bureaucracy, governed by an upper-class elite - the gentry - to which entrance was gained by passing an official examination.<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.010"/> In practice, admittance was often acquired by purchase<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.011"/>, and the gentry itself were in many ways reminiscent of Olson's "stationary bandits" (that is, tax revenue-maximising autocrats). </s><s n="s5.7;p2.5">This is confirmed by Lippit's description of the gentry as "drawing its income from the surplus produced by the peasants, artisans, and workers above their own subsistence requirements"<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.012"/>. </s><s n="s6.7;p2.5">Lippit also points out the gigantic income gap between labourers and officials, where officials' earnings range between 3,000 and 18,000 times that of labourers.<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.013"/> The gentry was only symbolically waged by the central government, and obtained the main part of their earnings through unauthorised taxes and bribes.<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.014"/>,<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.015"/> Thus, they were essentially free to collect whatever tax they preferred. </s><s n="s7.7;p2.5">Olson predicts that a rational autocrat chooses the revenue-maximising rate <hi rend="italic">r</hi>*, as illustrated in Figure 1. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.004"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Hobbes, Chapter 13. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.005"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Olson, 567. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.006"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 568. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.007"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 567-568. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.008"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 569. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.009"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 569. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.010"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Lippit, 78. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.011"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 78. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.012"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 78. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.013"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 79. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.014"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Moulder, 56-57. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.015"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Lippit, 79. </s></p></note><figure id="BAWE_0070a-fig.001"><head><hi rend="bold">Figure 1:</hi> <hi rend="italic">The relationship between tax rate and tax revenue, as proposed by Khaldun, Laffer, etc.</hi> <ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.016"/><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.016"><p n="pn1.1"> Blanchard, 500.</p></note></head></figure><p n="p3.5"><s n="s1.8;p3.5">Figure 1 demonstrates how taxation distorts economic incentives: as tax rate increases from zero to revenue-maximising <hi rend="italic">r</hi>*, the marginal increase in tax revenue diminishes due to the fall in output. </s><s n="s2.8;p3.5">At <hi rend="italic">r</hi>*, any further increase lowers output to much that tax revenue falls. </s><s n="s3.8;p3.5">Olson contrasts the expected behaviour of an autocratic ruler with that of a democratic one, and asserts that a rational democratic ruler will not push tax rates up to <hi rend="italic">r</hi>*: to look after his own self-interest -

the Netherlands and England - shared an essential common feature: the extensive system of legal and property rights enjoyed by their citizenry. </s><s n="s6.7;p4.5">In the Netherlands, the "private property of land ... was incorporated into the fundamental institutional arrangements"<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.033"/> and according to North and Thomas, the Dutch institutional framework was essentially equivalent to that of developed economies today, with the only exception that it lacked an efficient system for ensuring intellectual property rights.<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.034"/> An important discrepancy between the Netherlands and post-1689 Britain was that in the latter, a patents system for protecting intellectual property and innovations was actually put in place.<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.035"/> It is arguable that this was one of the main trigger for initiating large-scale industrialisation in Britain<ref target="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.036"/>, which other European countries would come to imitate later on. </s><s n="s7.7;p4.5">Thus, in accordance with Olson's theory, the establishment of a more democratic system of rule and an institutional framework potent enough to protect property rights in early Modern Europe seems to have stimulated economic growth. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.023"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 571. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.024"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 571-572. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.025"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Moulder, 59. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.026"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 59. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.027"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Balazs, 11. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.028"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 11. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.029"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Jones, 162. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.030"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 571. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.031"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Olson, 571. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.032"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Lippit, 56. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.033"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">North and Thomas, 143. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.034"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 134. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.035"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 152. </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070a-ftnote.036"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ibid., 153. </s></p></note><p n="p5.5"><s n="s1.4;p5.5">This essay has discussed Olson's theory of the correlation between democratic rule and economic development in the context of China under Qing rule and Western Europe since the late Middle Ages. </s><s n="s2.4;p5.5">In accordance with Olson's theory, the fact that the Chinese empire was governed by a gentry acting like tax-revenue maximising autocrats -
