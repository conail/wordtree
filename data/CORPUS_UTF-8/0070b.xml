target="BAWE_0070b-ftnote.002"/> displaying the value of everything produced in the formal sector of an economy, (including net income from abroad) divided by the size of the population. </s><s n="s2.5;p2.23">In this survey, mainly the GNI based on PPP will be discussed, as this better facilitates comparison of living standards between different countries than GNI converted at official exchange rates. </s><s n="s3.5;p2.23">Like the GNI per capita indicates the present state of an economy, the growth of GNI per capita reflects how an economy changes over time. </s><s n="s4.5;p2.23">It is imperative to realise that GNI per capita growth is not necessarily the result of output growth, but may as well follow from a population decline, a shift of production from the informal to the formal sector, or a change in real prices. </s><s n="s5.5;p2.23">Figure 1 shows annual GNI per capita growth over two time periods for the selected fifty countries according to region.

n="s1.2;p3.23">Figure 1 shows that most countries experienced moderate positive growth (2-6% p.a.) in both time periods. </s><s n="s2.2;p3.23">The red line separates the countries growing faster in the first and second period respectively; the further away the country is from the red line, the greater was the difference in growth rate between the two periods. </s></p><p n="p4.23"><s n="s1.6;p4.23">A regional trend is discerned for the Latin American and Caribbean region, where nearly all countries demonstrated lower growth rate in the second period. </s><s n="s2.6;p4.23">The situation seems to be particularly severe for Venezuela and Argentina, both experiencing negative growth in the second term. </s><s n="s3.6;p4.23">In Venezuela, this was arguably due to a "disastrous two-month national oil strike"<ref target="BAWE_0070b-ftnote.003"/> adversely affecting growth figures for 2002 and 2003. </s><s n="s4.6;p4.23">Argentina's negative growth in this period can be linked to the transition from a pegged to a floating exchange rate system<ref target="BAWE_0070b-ftnote.004"/> with consequent inflation (25.9% in 2002, 13.4% in 2003<ref target="BAWE_0070b-ftnote.005"/>), generating economic instability. </s><s n="s5.6;p4.23">Thus, there was no single reason for the falling growth rates in the region, although it is arguable that decline in one economy had adverse effects on neighbouring ones (e.g. by falling demand for imports). </s><s n="s6.6;p4.23">Only two countries, including Costa Rica (considered economically and politically stable for the region<ref target="BAWE_0070b-ftnote.006"/> ), maintained high and fairly stable growth rates in both periods. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070b-ftnote.003"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1"><hi

countries demonstrate very high average annual growth rates: Ukraine, Tajikistan, Moldova and Romania in the second period, and Armenia, Georgia and Belarus in both periods. </s><s n="s2.2;p5.23">These countries are "economies in transition" (shifting from planned to market economies), and several have adopted growth-promoting policies (sometimes under the influence of the IMF and the World Bank) such as of market liberalisation combined with monetary and fiscal tightening<ref target="BAWE_0070b-ftnote.007"/> Although this is a very heterogeneous group of countries - GNI per capita ranged between 730 (Tajikistan) and 5830 (Romania) in 2003 - it is arguable that they share some significant economic characteristics (as "transition economies"), and the great disparity during the first period could partially be attributed merely to the fact that they are in different stages of economic transition. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070b-ftnote.007"><p n="pn1.1"><s

China and Vietnam - communist states moving towards more market-oriented systems - being the front runners. </s><s n="s2.2;p6.23">Most African and Middle Eastern countries show a similar pattern, although it is arguable that many impoverished economies of Sub-Saharan Africa in particular would require significantly higher growth rates to substantially relieve poverty. </s></p><p n="p7.23"><s n="s1.2;p7.23">In Figure 1, Sierra Leone seems to be an astounding example of how to turn negative growth (-4.3%) in the first period to a positive number (18.3%) in the second period, outperforming all other countries. </s><s n="s2.2;p7.23">Here, an explanation will be attempted by considering some additional indicators on the Sierra Leonean economy (Table 1). </s></p><table

and as Table 1 indicates, the economy was every unstable throughout this period. </s><s n="s2.6;p8.23">Between 1995 and 1999, Sierra Leone experienced high levels of inflation, eroding currency value and purchasing power, whilst foreign aid per capita fell by more than two thirds. </s><s n="s3.6;p8.23">Since 1999, peacekeeping troops have been present and there has been a substantial injection of foreign aid<ref target="BAWE_0070b-ftnote.008"/> (450% increase 1999-2001). </s><s n="s4.6;p8.23">Comparing the amount of aid with GNI per capita (according to the Atlas Method, i.e. not adjusted for purchasing power), it is arguable that the GNI per capita increase can be explained by the increase in foreign aid alone. </s><s n="s5.6;p8.23">Also the stricter control of inflation after 1999 may have contributed to retaining the purchasing power of income. </s><s n="s6.6;p8.23">Thus, it is clear that the extraordinary sequence of annual growth rates depicted for Sierra Leone in Figure 1 need not necessarily indicate output growth. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0070b-ftnote.008"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1"><hi rend="italic">World Factbook</hi>, "Sierra Leone".

is arguable that economic development - improved living standards - is better evaluated using non-economic indicators, measuring social or environmental development. </s><s n="s2.4;p9.23">Here, two social indicators - life expectancy at birth and infant mortality rate - will be discussed. </s><s n="s3.4;p9.23">These indicators reflect various features correlated to economic development (e.g. the prevalence of disease, food availability, health-care standards). </s><s n="s4.4;p9.23">Table 2 shows the unweighted mean values of these two indicators for each region in the discussion.

expectancies displayed in Table 2, it is concluded that Sub-Saharan Africa diverges significantly from the other regions, signifying lower living standards. </s><s n="s2.2;p10.23">The same argument is mirrored in the figures for the infant mortality rate, which is twice as high in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to everywhere else. </s></p><p n="p11.23"><s n="s1.3;p11.23">Table 2 also invites the reader to conclude that that the infant mortality rate is higher in the Middle East and North Africa (40) than in Europe and Central Asia (25). </s><s n="s2.3;p11.23">However, the standard deviations for this indicator within each of these two groups (21 and 28 respectively) are so large that the difference in mean value (15) is rendered statistically insignificant. </s><s n="s3.3;p11.23">Furthermore, the unweighted mean values poorly reflect the actual situation of each region, as population differences are not accounted for: ideally, more populous countries should be given greater weight when determining the mean value for each region. </s></p><p n="p12.23"><s n="s1.1;p12.23">Figure 2 conveys a general idea about the infant mortality rate in developing and

countries (mainly African, but including Yemen and Cambodia) fall in the 85-125 range. </s><s n="s3.3;p13.23">In this study, infant mortality rates above 125 were found only in Sub-Saharan Africa, again emphasising the severity of the situation in this region. </s></p><p n="p14.23"><s n="s1.3;p14.23">The most notable feature of the data in Figure 2 is its positive skewness: most countries are found in the lower region of the range. </s><s n="s2.3;p14.23">The skewness explains why the mean value is significantly higher than the median. </s><s n="s3.3;p14.23">The large standard deviation reflects the wide spread: as evident from the graph, the data is not clustered around a single point. </s></p><p n="p15.23"><s n="s1.2;p15.23">Figure 2 clearly demonstrates the heterogeneity of the group in this study. </s><s n="s2.2;p15.23">Even the differences within a single class are so significant that it is debatable whether this grouping is acceptable at all: for instance, the gap between Croatia (6 deaths per 1,000 births) and Jordan (23) indicates a distinctive disparity in living standards. </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="bold">1.3 Contrasting economic and social development indicators</head><p n="p16.23"><s n="s1.2;p16.23">Discussing the importance of economic and social indicators of development raises the question of what insight can be obtained from comparing the two. </s><s n="s2.2;p16.23">Figure 3 shows the relationship between GNI per capita and life expectancy for the 50 countries (note that here, the value of GNI - not GNI growth - is considered, as the
