This new product 'Powermop' will enable P&amp;G to expand and diversify its existing product range under the Flash market. </s><s n="s3.4;p8.49">It will also expand the customer base to include new-to-market customers. </s><s n="s4.4;p8.49">A financial appraisal has been carried out and the results of the appraisal are given below. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Customer Margin</head><p n="p9.49"><s n="s1.9;p9.49">The current customer margins given to the customers are 10% for all three categories (Starter Kit, Refill Wipes and Solutions). </s><s n="s2.9;p9.49">Major customers contacted regarding the sale of this new product are hoping for a better margin. </s><s n="s3.9;p9.49">Taking this into account, the recommended customer margin is Low (10%) for the Starter Kit, High (18%) for the Refill Pads and Mid (12%) for the Refill Solutions. </s><s n="s4.9;p9.49">The category average will be 13.3% for Powermop. </s><s n="s5.9;p9.49">This is higher than the 10% currently given to the customers by P&amp;G and also higher than the customer margins given by our competitors. </s><s n="s6.9;p9.49">Mop and Go only offers on average 10% for their existing product and FlooroBeam, who gained a large market share recently by launching a new product, is offering on average 13% to the customers. </s><s n="s7.9;p9.49">If P&amp;G offers 13.3% for the new product 'Powermop', this is likely to attract customers and their willingness to sell the new product in their stores. </s><s n="s8.9;p9.49">This customer margin of 13.3% is going to generate a positive NPV and also similar payback period to a lower customer margin of 11.3%. </s><s n="s9.9;p9.49">Therefore, given that this higher customer margin of 13.3% will make the customers happier and in return, build good relationships between P&amp;G with the customers, the customer margin of 13.3% is highly recommended. </s></p><p n="p10.49"><s n="s1.5;p10.49">This high customer margin can also be seen as a form of barrier to entry into the new product market. </s><s n="s2.5;p10.49">Knowing that the competitors will react and launch a similar product in the future, a high customer margin will more or less discourage them. </s><s n="s3.5;p10.49">This is because if the size of the research and development department or the company is small, the cost of launching the new product will be higher and it will be difficult to offer the customers a similar customer margin. </s><s n="s4.5;p10.49">Offering a similar customer margin as high as that of P&amp;G will generate a loss for the company. </s><s n="s5.5;p10.49">If a lower customer margin is offered, the customers might be unhappy to take it and sell in their stores. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head

worthwhile. </s><s n="s2.5;p15.49">However in this appraisal, the impact of inflation has not been taken into account. </s><s n="s3.5;p15.49">If all cash flows are affected by the same rate of inflation, then the impact can be ignored. </s><s n="s4.5;p15.49">Another effect that has been ignored is taxation. </s><s n="s5.5;p15.49">Ignoring tax is likely to overstate the NPV of the project because taxation affects the cash flow in terms of capital allowance and tax charge. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Factors That May Change Over The Life Of The Project </head><p n="p16.49"><s n="s1.4;p16.49">This project is assumed to have a life of 3 years. </s><s n="s2.4;p16.49">Within these 3 years, the market growth may be different from the projected 5% for each year. </s><s n="s3.4;p16.49">This might be because consumers are not aware of the existence of such product in the market or they are not confident with this new product because of lack of advertisement and promotion. </s><s n="s4.4;p16.49">If the growth is slower, the sales of 'Powermop' will be affected and might lead to a negative NPV. </s></p><p n="p17.49"><s n="s1.3;p17.49">The assumption that competitors will react in the same trend as previous times might be wrong. </s><s n="s2.3;p17.49">Competitors might have acquired the technology necessary to develop similar products earlier than expected. </s><s n="s3.3;p17.49">If Mop and Go reacts in 6 months' time and FlooroBeam in 1 year's time, P&amp;G might lose all the growth in the new market 1 year after the launch of 'Powermop'. </s></p><p n="p18.49"><s n="s1.2;p18.49">There is also possibility that new players will enter the market thus creating greater competition. </s><s n="s2.2;p18.49">P&amp;G must be aware of
