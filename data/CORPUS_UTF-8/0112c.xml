Homologous recombination can physically occur in any part of the bacterial DNA strand, the only requirement is the presence of DNA with a significant region of homology to it. </s><s n="s4.6;p27.28">The phage λ integration however is site specific and can only occur between the gene coding for biotin production and galactose metabolism because it is between theses two sites that the attachment sires <hi rend="italic">attB</hi> is found. </s><s n="s5.6;p27.28">A further difference between the two is the ability of the phage λ DNA integration reaction to be reversed, allowing the phage DNA to be excised again specifically which allows the virus to move from a lysogenic state into a lytic phase. </s><s n="s6.6;p27.28">The reversal of the genetic recombination reaction doesn't occur during homologous recombination. </s></p><p n="p28.28"><s n="s1.1;p28.28">There are several other methods of genetic recombination n bacteria including transposon integration along with several other bacteriophage integration method, for it is often the case that different lysogenic bacteriophage have varying methods of chromosome integration. </s></p></div1></body><back><div1 type="bibliography"><head rend="underlined">Bibliography</head><div2 type="bibliography"><head rend="underlined">Journals</head><p>Arnold, D.
