Three trials used riluzole at 100 mg/day and one used doses of 50, 100 and 200mg/day. Individuals were under 75 years, had a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ³60% in three trials, with two of these also excluding patients who had suffered from MND for more than 5 years. The fourth trial recruited individuals who were older or who had a greater duration of disease (> 5 years) or who had a FVC&lt;60%. All trials used tracheostomy-free survival as a primary outcome. Most individuals (in all four trials) were prevalent, rather than incident cases. The assessment report reviewed the results from all four of the trials identified and reported riluzole to be associated with a relative reduction in hazard ratio for tracheostomy-free survival at 18 months of 17% (i.e. hazard ratio of 0.88, 95% CI: 0.75-1.02). There was some evidence of heterogeneity across the results of these four trials. Current estimates of the cost-effectiveness of riluzole must be viewed cautiously. Some of the key remaining uncertainties on benefits for the economic analysis concern the disease stage(s) in which the survival gain is experienced, the quality of life utility weights for ALS health states and the mean gain in life expectancy for individuals who take riluzole. Estimates from the two fully published trials suggest a gain in median tracheostomy free survival time of 2 months to 4 months. It is clear that riluzole is associated with a net increase in costs to the health service, though the magnitude of the increase is difficult to predict accurately. The Appraisal Committee considered the evidence of the clinical and cost effectiveness of this technology by reference to the Directions to the Institute issued by the Secretary of State. The Committee took account of the severity and relatively short life span of people with ALS and in particular, as directly reported to it, of the values which patients place on the extension of tracheostomy free survival time. With these considerations in mind, the Committee considered that the net increase in cost for the NHS of the use of riluzole in this indication was reasonable when set against the benefit, assessed as extended months of an acceptable (to patients) quality of life [1].</quote></div2></div1><div1 type="section"><head><hi rend="bold">Commentary</hi> A commentary on issues of epidemiology, psycho-social, health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</head><p n="p26.39"><s n="s1.7;p26.39">Motor Neurone Disease is a degenerative disease of unknown cause that affects predominantly motor neurons of the spinal cord, cranial nerve nuclei and motor cortex. </s><s n="s2.7;p26.39">It therefore affects both upper and lower motor neurones. </s><s n="s3.7;p26.39">Its incidence is approximately 2/100 000, except in endemic areas such as Guam. </s><s n="s4.7;p26.39">Prevalence is 5-6/100 000. </s><s n="s5.7;p26.39">It is twice as common in males. </s><s n="s6.7;p26.39">The mean age of onset is 55 years, although the youngest recorded case was 16, and the eldest 77 years of age. </s><s n="s7.7;p26.39">Diagnosis is clinical; it is usually an easily identifiable condition. </s></p><p n="p27.39"><s n="s1.1;p27.39">It has three classifications: </s></p><p rend="bulleted" n="p28.39"><s n="s1.3;p28.39"><hi rend="bold">Amytrophic lateral sclerosis</hi>- The most common form, accounting for 65-85% of cases of MND.
