n="s2.3;p23.26">Corporate ownership is still concentrated, and collective bargaining and co-determination maintain to cover majority of the employees. </s><s n="s3.3;p23.26">Similarly, the changes are more noticed in large corporations rather than among small and medium enterprises (SMEs). </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Conclusions </head><p n="p24.26"><s n="s1.5;p24.26">To summarise, the article consists of two main parts. </s><s n="s2.5;p24.26">Firstly, it has reviewed the general argument on convergence of national corporate governance. </s><s n="s3.5;p24.26">The view that a new hybrid model of corporate governance seems to be emerging is favoured, with the characteristics of strong control by shareholders and concern of other stakeholders. </s><s n="s4.5;p24.26">Factors which might drive the convergence have been indicated with regard to economic globalisation, corporate internationalization and the raising of political regulations. </s><s n="s5.5;p24.26">Secondly, changes that are more or less associated with the corporate governance system in Germany are identified and related driven factors have been discussed with deeper reference to the German case. </s></p><p n="p25.26"><s n="s1.7;p25.26">German economy has encountered some serious difficulties within the typical stakeholder system of corporate governance. </s><s n="s2.7;p25.26">Meanwhile, the pressure and opportunities brought by globalisation in terms of changing in capital market have stimulated its changing towards a shareholder-value-oriented model. </s><s n="s3.7;p25.26">Foreign investors have largely increased their shareholdings in German enterprises, especially to the big corporations. </s><s n="s4.7;p25.26">Investors monitor the performances of firms through both direct and indirect mechanisms. </s><s n="s5.7;p25.26">Similarly, the role of banks has seemed to change from the patient capital to profit-focused investment institutions. </s><s n="s6.7;p25.26">In order to seeking for free capital rather than banks credit funding, German firms have attempted to be listed in both domestic new stock market and foreign ones like Nasdap and NYSE. Moreover, actions of multinational corporations such as Volkswagen and Siemens are flagship companies who adopt the attitude towards the shareholder oriented model. </s><s n="s7.7;p25.26">Furthermore, government policies have also accelerated the dynamic changing process of German corporate governance system. </s></p><p n="p26.26"><s n="s1.6;p26.26">Nevertheless, due to the resistance from stakeholders, especially employees and the institutional context constraints in Germany as well as the weaknesses of shareholder model, the fundamental changes of corporate governance in a fairly large scale in German industry have not appeared. </s><s n="s2.6;p26.26">Some argue that so far German enterprises are unlikely to operate identically as the ones in Anglo-American countries do. </s><s n="s3.6;p26.26">Moreover, whether those changes will bring positive effect to German economy is not convinced. </s><s n="s4.6;p26.26">However, the evidences show that Germany is undertaking a series of significant changes. </s><s n="s5.6;p26.26">Whether the outcomes will emerge as expected and whether these returns are sustainable ought to be concerned by different interest group in Germany. </s><s n="s6.6;p26.26">However, it is beyond the discussion of this paper. </s></p></div1></body><back><div1 type="bibliography"><head rend="bold">References </head><p>Berger, S and Dore, R.
