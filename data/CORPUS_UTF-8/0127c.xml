thousands of people in the pneumonic form of tularemia, which is the most serious. </s><s n="s4.5;p39.42">This combined with a low infectious does will have disastrous consequences. </s><s n="s5.5;p39.42">If medical personnel are unable to recognize tularemia and threat it accordingly, resources will be inefficiently used and more importantly deaths can occur. </s></p><p n="p40.42"><s n="s1.8;p40.42"><hi rend="italic">F. tularensis</hi> is so virulent because it is able to evade the immune system effectively. </s><s n="s2.8;p40.42">Its lipid capsule prevents phagocytosis and lysis by complement, the acid phosphatase enzyme prevents respiratory burst and is able to inhibit cytokine release by the macrophages. </s><s n="s3.8;p40.42">However, the lipopolysaccharide layer of the cell envelope does not act as an endotoxin. </s><s n="s4.8;p40.42">This is the extent of the knowledge available concerning the virulence of <hi rend="italic">F. tularensis</hi>. </s><s

to other genres, its genome encodes 1,804 open reading frames, 1,289 of which encode proteins of which 413 are unique to <hi rend="italic">Franciscella4</hi>. </s><s n="s7.8;p40.42">This indicates that <hi rend="italic">F. tularensis</hi> may posses many unique genes which may confer unique virulence factors as yet undiscovered and not adapted to the human host. </s><s n="s8.8;p40.42">Vital research must therefore occur in order to increase understanding of this pathogen such as how it penetrates the gut in gastrointestinal tularemia. </s></p><p n="p41.42"><s n="s1.6;p41.42">The use of
