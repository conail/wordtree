and taxation, Atusparia mediated a wave of Indian discontent at exploitation. </s><s n="s3.4;p23.25">Atusparia's supporters would appropriate their militancy as affirming their status as true citizens, seeking to unhinge a system that neglected the reciprocity intrinsic to fiscal convention.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.058"/> This incident would inspire numerous subsequent examples,

government and elite dominance.<ref target="BAWE_0130j-ftnote.061"/> With the Indian more concretely transformed into a racial 'other', the cultural and political void between coast and sierra was

alterations to tribute and taxation systems, the erosion of communal property rights, and participation in a war with a foreign power all contributed to heighten Indian acknowledgement of the nation state. </s><s n="s3.10;p25.25">The general trend towards a liberal republican direction would nonetheless prove at odds with the indigenous population's desire to maintain their traditional
