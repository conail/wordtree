(2004). </s><s n="s2.5;p7.9">Their study lasted for one year, giving plenty of time for sufficient data collection. </s><s n="s3.5;p7.9">The subjects used in the work had their age, sex deprivation category and other relevant details recorded; this enables judgements on transferability to be made about the findings, though it should be noted that these details are obtained by contacting the authors directly. </s><s n="s4.5;p7.9">The actual interviews were tape recorded, in line with recommendations made by Silverman (1997) whereby original data sources are kept to enable findings to be compared to the data, reducing the problems from reflexivity. </s><s n="s5.5;p7.9">However, little other consideration is given to reflexivity, particularly the effect of the interviews on the terminal subjects and the results on their views. </s></p><p n="p8.9"><s n="s1.4;p8.9">Thompson, Rehman and Humbert (2005) studied the factors affecting the physical activity of children and youths. </s><s n="s2.4;p8.9">Many of the subject's responses were restricted in the questionnaire and the semi-structured interview, and so care must be taken that these restrictions do not impose the researcher's own agenda onto the responses. </s><s n="s3.4;p8.9">In addition, the ages of children studied were given, but were restricted to only three age groups, something that may limit the transferability of the findings. </s><s n="s4.4;p8.9">However, the researchers do plentifully quote the subjects' responses in the results section, following Geertz's (1973, as cited by Johnson, 1999) recommendation for a 'thick description'. </s></p><p n="p9.9"><s n="s1.1;p9.9">In conclusion, we have seen that qualitative research does have a place in psychology, but that research must be carried out sensitively and methodically if it is to be of high quality, with just as much, if not more, consideration as quantitative work. </s></p></div1></body><back><div1 type="bibliography"><head rend="underlined">References</head><p>Burt, K., &amp; Oaksford, M.
