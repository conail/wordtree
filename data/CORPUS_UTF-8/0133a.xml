preventing and detection of crimes, which was clear through the explanatory notes. </s></p><p n="p5.12"><s n="s1.7;p5.12">One of the main questions before the House of Lords was whether retention interfered with an individual's rights under articles 8 and 14 of the Convention. </s><s n="s2.7;p5.12">The judge reasoned that retention of DNA samples and fingerprints help widen the database so that more matches can be made ensuring speedier apprehension of criminals and a higher degree of justice meted out. </s><s n="s3.7;p5.12">He referred to what the Commission had to say about the matter, which was that it was 'open to question'<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.002"/>, and Dr Bramley's statement that the database was rigorously protected and had strong safeguards to prevent any misuse. </s><s n="s4.7;p5.12">Levenson J said that retention has no impact on a person's private life as an untutored eye cannot recognize a DNA sample and relate it to a person. </s><s n="s5.7;p5.12">To make a match an experienced professional or/and sophisticated instruments are needed. </s><s n="s6.7;p5.12">The database just contains the sample and the information of the person to

those who had not been required to provide samples was not on one of the proscribed grounds in article 14 and that it fell out of the definition of 'other status'<ref

said that it created a suspicion in respect to those acquitted. </s><s n="s4.12;p9.12">Lord Steyn disagreed. </s><s n="s5.12;p9.12">He established that without a sample from the crime scene a match could not be made. </s><s n="s6.12;p9.12">The retained samples would not be made public. </s><s n="s7.12;p9.12">A person cannot be identified to an untutored eye just by looking at the samples on the

caught in the future<ref target="BAWE_0133a-endnote.009"/>. </s><s n="s10.12;p9.12">Also for the Chief Constable to decide on his discretion (on a case to case basis) whether the person is free of any
