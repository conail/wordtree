factor in increasing abstention for the different and changing methods of registration and voting can become confusing and misleading, particularly to the more mobile citizens of America who generally have to re-register every time they move. </s><s n="s6.6;p10.20">Large Hispanic communities where Spanish is spoken at home and where a decent understanding of English is not always accessible among

representation of much of the electorate due to a two-party democracy. </s><s n="s2.5;p11.20">For example, in recent years where the Democrat Party have shifted ever more to the right, there has been a notable lack of representation of people who take left-wing stances on issues in the United States. </s><s n="s3.5;p11.20">This is supported by the success of Ralph Nader in the 2000 elections. </s><s n="s4.5;p11.20">However, it is arguable that this was not such an important factor in 2004, where feelings of anger towards Bush among left-wing voters, particularly in relation to issues such as the war in Iraq, the environment and the deregulation of industries, meant that rather than abstaining, they felt the importance and urgency of voting for Kerry. </s><s n="s5.5;p11.20">This may

to the white house' is a very close battle, is likely to have the psychological effect of provoking people to vote, for to refer to the rational choice model, the probability that one's vote would be a deciding vote is increased. </s><s n="s3.10;p13.20">This could have been a factor in the 2004 elections, where for months the pollsters reported leads of no more than a few percentage points. </s><s n="s4.10;p13.20">However, this is likely to affect those people who already intended to vote because they were concerned in the first place about who would win. </s><s n="s5.10;p13.20">The second interpretation refers to the competition created by opposing policies of the two parties. </s><s n="s6.10;p13.20">This could have been the case in the 2004 elections, for it was clear that Kerry took an opposing view of Bush's action in Iraq. </s><s n="s7.10;p13.20">However, many felt that he failed to offer an alternative solution and that, if he was elected President, his policies, (in particular, foreign), would not differ greatly from George Bush's. </s><s n="s8.10;p13.20">This may have contributed to a greater feeling of despondency and apathy among left-wing voters, who may have resorted to abstention. </s><s n="s9.10;p13.20">The issues at stake in an election and the policies adopted towards them by the two parties could be a main reason for abstention in the United States. </s><s n="s10.10;p13.20">America has a very wide selection of sub-cultures and communities with greatly varying attitudes toward politics and policies, and it is inevitable that the issues raised by politicians are not those which concern a large proportion of the population. </s></p><p n="p14.20"><s n="s1.5;p14.20">The resulting exposure of fraud and possible corruption following the 2000 election, has led to an awareness that one's vote, despite having registered, may not be counted. </s><s n="s2.5;p14.20">In the run up to the 2004 elections, NPR news reported administrative problems in registration. </s><s n="s3.5;p14.20">For example, in Ohio where the GOP secretary of state refused to accept registration forms printed in the newspaper because they were not the correct weight of paper and the allegations by democrats that the organisation employed by republicans to administer the registration of voters, was directed to destroy registration applications from likely democrats. </s><s n="s4.5;p14.20">Allegations and speculation ran high in the 2004 elections. </s><s n="s5.5;p14.20">Whether they hold any truth or not, the effect of doubt in the electoral system could be quite considerable among non-voters. </s></p><p n="p15.20"><s n="s1.5;p15.20">To summarise, despite the fact that party organisations are stronger than ever and that the election process has become a professional and rich industry, it seems many people feel disengaged from politics in America. </s><s n="s2.5;p15.20">This is indicated by the fact that the number of people under 35 who read a daily newspaper has dropped from two thirds in 1965 to one third in 1990.<ref target="BAWE_0135c-ftnote.007"/> It is likely that in some cases, abstention is an indication of contentment, particularly among the middle class suburban communities, where the quality of life in most cases is acceptably high. </s><s n="s3.5;p15.20">However, for those who could benefit from political reform, particularly in relation to healthcare and unemployment, abstention could be a result of some of the practical difficulties in registering and voting, outlined above. </s><s n="s4.5;p15.20">People with lower individual means, (e.g. education, income, experience), have fewer resources to cover the costs of participation which will involve processing information, reaching decisions and finding the time to vote. </s><s n="s5.5;p15.20">This can result in apathetic attitudes which makes it harder to motivate people in this situation to vote. <ref target="BAWE_0135c-ftnote.008"/> </s></p><note place="foot"
