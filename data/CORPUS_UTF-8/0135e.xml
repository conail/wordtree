To adopt the theoretical view mentioned above, the argument of whether this leads to ineffectiveness in the UN would differ according to one's expectations of its aims. Clearly, to a liberal-socialist, the unequal power that the five permanent members can exercise is undemocratic and un-representative. It could be argued that the five permanent members no longer reflect the most important or significant world powers, that large geographical parts of the world are unrepresented and that the whole concept of allowing certain members more power than others undermines the principles of the UN as identified by Chris Brown: "International relations would become a realm of law and not a realm of power"<ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.006"/>.</quote><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.005"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ransom, D Upside Down: The United Nations at 60, <hi rend="underlined">New Internationalist</hi> Vol. 375: p.9-12 </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.006"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Brown, C (2001) <hi rend="underlined">Understanding International Relations</hi> Palgrave p.141 </s></p></note><p n="p5.8"><s n="s1.1;p5.8">While, this inherent problem may produce ineffectiveness, for example in the use of abstention over Israeli occupation of the West Bank, there are more significant problems which the UN faces, which I will address later in the essay. </s></p><p n="p6.8"><s n="s1.13;p6.8">The invasion of Iraq led to criticism of the UN throughout the world: "The UN's credibility was down in the US because it did not support the US Administration on the war, and in 19 other countries because it did not prevent the war." </s><ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.007"/><s n="s2.13;p6.8">Whilst it has been argued that some of these 19 countries pursued their own self-interests in refusing to back America, here I will argue that this event must be put into the context of an ideological struggle. </s><s n="s3.13;p6.8">Madeleine Albright (former US ambassador to the United Nations), describes the approach the Bush Administration has adopted towards the UN: "they started acting as if the UN were a burden and denigrated it"<ref target="BAWE_0135e-ftnote.008"/>. </s><s n="s4.13;p6.8">It must be asked, why is the UN a burden to the US?
