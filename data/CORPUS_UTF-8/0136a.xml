n="s3.7;p30.45">The work ethic of 'emotional labour' was first described by Hochschild (1983) but quite a lot of authors have picked on it now. </s><s n="s4.7;p30.45">Hochschild, first used the term, emotional labour, as 'the management of human feeling, during social interaction within the labour process as shaped by the dictates of capital accumulation', having three elements: feeling management as part of paid work; mainly during social interaction within the workplace; supervision and measurement to the performance of employees. </s><s n="s5.7;p30.45">In addition, emotional labour was divided into two categories: 'surface act' that deceives not oneself but others (e.g. maintaining outward appearance); 'deep act' that deceives oneself as much as deceiving others (e.g. the direct exhortation of feeling). </s><s n="s6.7;p30.45">Thus, emotional labour is demanded in the new workplace as standardised goods and services by means of the mass production are not able to satisfy the quantity or detail of customer' needs any more, and 'quality-conscious consumers' have emerged largely (Hochschild, 1983: 84, 85, 86). </s><s n="s7.7;p30.45">Emotional labour can also be defined as 'the regulation and expression of emotion in exchange for a wage' (Holman, 2003:127). </s></p><p n="p31.45"><s n="s1.6;p31.45">Rose and Wright (2005) believe 'emotional labour' to be twofold. </s><s n="s2.6;p31.45">On one hand it can be a constant source of burden and pressure, as not every employee can feel positive and motivated all the time, which causes dissonance between real feelings and the feelings on display. </s><s n="s3.6;p31.45">This dissonance has been connected to emotional exhaustion and lower job satisfaction (Holman, 2003). </s><s n="s4.6;p31.45">On the other hand, it makes

'the increasingly intensified pace of work suggests in practice that the system facilitates little more than the minimum service standard.' </s><s n="s3.4;p32.45">This viewpoint documented by Holdsworth and Cartwright (2003) clearly suggests that employees find it hard to maintain quality in service when they have to deal with calls quickly and have the pressure of a large number of customers still waiting to be served. </s><s n="s4.4;p32.45">This puts them under a lot of mental pressure. </s></p><p n="p33.45"><s n="s1.6;p33.45">Within the emotional labour process of an organisation, management should provide emotional empowerment (e.g. </s><s n="s2.6;p33.45">Total Quality Management through team working) for its employees, as management cannot possibly train their employees with regard to every possible interaction between them and the customers, although they attempt to prescribe the likely feelings and expressions of customers. </s><s n="s3.6;p33.45">However, to eliminate negative discretion and encourage positive, the emotional labour within the organisation is supervised by monitoring and controlling that are associated with performed-related pay system. </s><s n="s4.6;p33.45">Furthermore, employees are forced to deploy emotional labour - deep act rather than surface act -, not least due to the changing concept of service from technical delivery towards focusing on how it is delivered and competitive environment in the service sector (Taylor, 1998). </s><s n="s5.6;p33.45">For example, an employee at Flight path explained in relation to her
