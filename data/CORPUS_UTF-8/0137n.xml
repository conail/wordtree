have often attributed full agency to men while women have been relegated to being a passive recipient. </s><s n="s3.4;p39.44">To counter this traditional and gendered notion of victimhood, the essay has pushed forth arguments for women's empowerment in ethnic conflicts based on empirical evidences obtained from the Rwandan, Yugoslavian and Sri Lankan case studies. </s><s n="s4.4;p39.44">By first understanding the basis of the victimhood discourse, academic scholarship should transcend that by taking a step further to examine how women often play a greater role than presumed - as mothers of

empowerment which may be transitory and elusive. </s><s n="s5.5;p40.44">Hence women, like men, are capable of being empowered in ethnic conflicts which open up new opportunities and spaces for new

to which women may be empowered by their roles and experiences in ethnic conflicts has "theoretical and practical ramifications for gender sensitive analyses as well as for national or international feminist politics".<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.078"/> Most feminist human rights theorists and activists have often built their arguments for more equality and justice on the basis of gender discrimination and female victimhood. </s><s n="s2.5;p42.44">This illuminates a broader conundrum for feminists: "how do they address women's human rights if in so 'doing', they rectify certain

n="s4.5;p42.44">For many feminists who are committed to peace, the notion of female perpetrators becomes an anomaly in their studies, indirectly affirming the perception that women are almost always conceived as victims and nothing more. </s><s n="s5.5;p42.44">On this note, there should definitely be more awareness for women's rights in conflicts but we should not overplay women's victimhood in

illuminate women's identities and lives.<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.081"/> Since the experience and threat of sexual violence has been a dominant feature in the construction of women's identities in relation to men, "victimhood constitutes a core element in women's understanding of themselves".<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.082"/> From this point of departure, women are equally empowered to construct themselves with the identity of peace activists or agents of war when the opportunities arise.<ref target="BAWE_0137n-ftnote.083"/> Henceforth, we have progressed from examining the
