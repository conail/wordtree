n="s4.9;p2.8">Whereas Realism therefore "paints a rather grim picture of world politics"<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.005"/>, Liberal notions convey a significantly more optimistic view. </s><s n="s5.9;p2.8">The numerous strands of Liberalism hold that human nature is basically good, and that the interest of the state is bound up with that of its people; furthermore, states are capable of cooperation in a system where international institutions are essential actors. </s><s n="s6.9;p2.8">Unlike Realism which considers only relative gains in world politics, Liberalism stresses the importance of interdependence as a means of achieving gains in absolute terms<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.006"/>. </s><s n="s7.9;p2.8">Finally, the Marxist representation of the international system is one dominated not by states but by classes, where capitalist modes of production and class struggle shape political outcomes. </s><s n="s8.9;p2.8">Economics plays a crucial part in this system, as

n="p3.8"><s n="s1.7;p3.8">As a student of world politics seeking a straightforward understanding of the international system, I can begin to evaluate these rival ideologies in a purely pragmatic manner by comparing the relative parsimony of each world view. </s><s n="s2.7;p3.8">Realism offers an attractively simple conception of international relations that may explain its ongoing popularity in political analysis: it maintains that states are unitary, rational, and self-interested actors which will behave in the interests of national survival<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.009"/>. </s><s n="s3.7;p3.8">By contrast, Liberalism encompasses numerous sub-state and non-state actors into its analysis, and argues that moral and humanitarian factors also influence state behaviour, which creates a more complex and possibly more normative view of the international system. </s><s n="s4.7;p3.8">Marxism, on the other hand, facilitates one's comprehension of international relations by relying on a concise representation of international relations dynamics: the materialistic base-superstructure model. </s><s n="s5.7;p3.8">According to this model, societal transformation originates from the tension between means and relations of production (respectively, the proletariat and the bourgeoise); this forms an economic base, which in turn determines a superstructure of legal, political and cultural institutions<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.010"/>. </s><s n="s6.7;p3.8">However, the Frankfurt School's attempts to analyse the social world as a totality by considering notions such as culture and philosophy has complicated later strands of Marxist analysis<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.011"/>. </s><s n="s7.7;p3.8">Thus, in evaluating Realism, Liberalism and Marxism simply

the a model's simplicity and the depth of analysis that it provides. </s><s n="s2.10;p4.8">In evaluating these theories, I must therefore also consider the possibility that these ideologies rely on unviable assumptions. </s><s n="s3.10;p4.8">While its simplicity is appealing, Realism has been criticised for offering a "one-dimensional"<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.012"/> interpretation of state behaviour: it rejects the influence of non-power motivations or of non-state actors in the decision-making process. </s><s n="s4.10;p4.8">Furthermore, by defining power solely in terms of resources, this world view ignores the significance of power capabilities and of ideological power, which Waltz and Hobbes both see as a substantial omission<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.013"/>. </s><s n="s5.10;p4.8">While less clearly simplistic, the assumptions of Liberalism may also misrepresent the international system through a utopian belief in man's possibilities of intellectual, moral, and social improvement. </s><s n="s6.10;p4.8">Liberal institutionalism, in particular, sees a 'natural order' underlying human society, a notion that even the Idealist strand considers unlikely<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.014"/>. </s><s n="s7.10;p4.8">Certain Marxist conjectures appear similarly implausible. </s><s n="s8.10;p4.8">Particularly, Marxism relies on the existence of an ongoing tension between capitalist and working classes. </s><s n="s9.10;p4.8">According to Herbert Marcuse, however, the masses may no longer be capable of undertaking emancipatory revolution, as "one-dimensional man" has been integrated into the capitalist system and is now unable to envisage an alternative to this status-quo<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.015"/>. </s><s n="s10.10;p4.8">Due to

</s><s n="s3.9;p5.8">For example, Realist relative-gains considerations were central to determining Cold War foreign policy tactics<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.016"/>. </s><s n="s4.9;p5.8">Mearsheimer also uses the historical record to attack Liberal ideology: based on the failure of the League of Nations in maintaining peace after 1914, he undermines the claim that international institutions can maintain collective security<ref target="BAWE_0138c-ftnote.017"/>. </s><s n="s5.9;p5.8">However, I do not believe that these examples necessarily demonstrate Realism's supremacy over the other world views: more recent developments, such as NATO's 1999 intervention in Kosovo on a humanitarian basis, are better explained from a Liberal than a Realist perspective<ref
