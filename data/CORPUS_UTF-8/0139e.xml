that a shared language particularly fosters national belonging. </s><s n="s5.8;p2.8">Certain groups, such as Canada's Francophones in Quebec, are indeed highly sensitive to the dissolution of their language; nevertheless, language alone cannot define a nation. </s><s n="s6.8;p2.8">Different dialects may coexist within a country - in Switzerland French, Italian, are German are all official languages - without damaging its sense of nationalism<ref target="BAWE_0139e-ftnote.008"/>. </s><s n="s7.8;p2.8">Furthermore, for Eric Hobsbawm, "national languages are almost always semi-artificial constructs", as, far from being a national culture's primary foundation, a common language is obtained only after the painstaking selection and standardisation of particular dialects<ref target="BAWE_0139e-ftnote.009"/>. </s><s n="s8.8;p2.8">In France in 1789, only 20% of the population spoke French, and when Italy unified in 1860, only 2.5% spoke Italian<ref

where Orthodox, Uniate and Roman Catholic beliefs intermingle<ref target="BAWE_0139e-ftnote.012"/>. </s><s n="s4.7;p3.8">Ethnicity, likewise, is only one component of nationalism: whilst it can heighten nationalistic divisions by categorically distinguishing 'insiders' from 'outsiders', ethnic groups - such as the Basques or the Kurds - often cut across states<ref

it is dangerously influential - since the French Revolution, nationalism has repeatedly been misused to secure specific governmental aims. </s><s n="s4.9;p6.8">Even liberal nationalism, the ideology's oldest form, establishes a dangerous distinction between 'us' and 'others' that has since fostered xenophobia and - in the case of Nazi Germany - even genocide. </s><s n="s5.9;p6.8">Expansionist nationalism carries a similarly aggressive potential: following the 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century collapse of the Ottoman, Hapsburg and Tsarist empires, this strand of nationalism transformed European nation-building into uncompromising 'jingoist' projects of imperial conquest<ref target="BAWE_0139e-ftnote.028"/>. </s><s n="s6.9;p6.8">As European powers competed for colonial control, the ideology's militaristic approach fostered intense patriotism based on "martial principles of absolute loyalty, complete dedication and willing self-sacrifice"<ref target="BAWE_0139e-ftnote.029"/> for the nation, precipitating the outbreak of the two World Wars. </s><s n="s7.9;p6.8">Having spread to Africa and Asia through independence struggles in the 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century, nationalism is today gaining a conservative slant: its focus has largely shifted from issues of self-determination to prospects of social cohesion and public order. </s><s n="s8.9;p6.8">Such conservative nationalism has however also been misused - its xenophobic claims to protect domestic populations against the 'outside world' have for instance backed both the 1981 Falklands War and the USA's ongoing 'war on terror'<ref target="BAWE_0139e-ftnote.030"/>. </s><s n="s9.9;p6.8">Visibly, past nationalist movements have not solely upheld Rousseau's virtues of freedom and self-representation - rather,

with its increased migration, its threats to state sovereignty imposed by supranational institutions and transnational corporations, and its emerging cosmopolitan community, may indeed be rendering
