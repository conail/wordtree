ATP hydrolysis</hi> : Binding of ATP to the empty site O (AB) brings about hydrolysis in the H site by catalytic site cooperativity (BC). Combined binding and hydrolysis of ATP occur with 90° rotation of γ , which is also associated with switch in conformations of the catalytic sites (`binding change'). Pi is released (CD) associated with 30° rotation of γ , followed by ADP release (DA) to regenerate the starting ground state.<hi rend="underlined">b.

This allows discrimination so that ADP binds (IIIII) despite an unfavourable [ATP]/[ADP] ratio in the cell of ≥ 10/1. Next the binding change occurs (IIIIIIV) and ADP+Pi condense chemically at the (new) H site. Release of ATP involves transformation of an H site via L to O site (IIIIVI).
