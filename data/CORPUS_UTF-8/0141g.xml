as different strains of <hi rend="italic">B. anthracis</hi>. </s><s n="s4.5;p4.29">In short, these analyses concluded that the common ancestor of <hi rend="italic">B. cereus</hi> must be an insect pathogen rather than a soil bacterium. </s><s n="s5.5;p4.29">Other important results, such as the location of potential virulence factors and genes encoding surface proteins which could be targets for

</s><s n="s4.5;p25.29">In addition, adhesion lipoproteins including an endocarditis specific antigen, sortases and LPxTG motif cell wall surface anchor proteins were identified. </s><s n="s5.5;p25.29">Due to the atypical nucleotide composition of the LPxTG proteins, Paulsen <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. suggest there are from foreign origin. </s></p><p n="p26.29"><s n="s1.6;p26.29">To evade the immune system, a common tactic of pathogens is to have antigenic or phase variation of surface structures. </s><s n="s2.6;p26.29">This is indeed the case for <hi rend="italic">E. faecalis</hi>: almost half of the surface exposed proteins found contained homopolymeric sequences or iterative nucleotide motifs located within the ORF or promoter region, enabling "phase variation via a slippage type mechanism." </s><s n="s3.6;p26.29">(Paulsen <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2003) Moreover, a large proportion of the <hi rend="italic">E. faecalis</hi> V583 genome

identification of virulence factors and surface exposed proteins that may be important drug targets against this pathogen, similar to how the study of <hi rend="italic">B. anthracis</hi> revealed SLH

be seen that genome based analysis is a powerful tool, which can be used for investigating unexpected outbreaks of infectious diseases in all circumstances: spanning from biological warfare attacks, emerging agents to familiar pathogens. </s><s n="s2.2;p27.29">As even monomorphic species like <hi rend="italic">B. anthracis</hi> show phenotypic variation in infection potential, the technique of genomic comparison can be used to investigate the genetic basis of pathogenesis. </s></p><p n="p28.29"><s n="s1.6;p28.29">According to Read <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., comparative analyses based on whole genome sequence data provide the most comprehensive picture of species diversity and does not pose the bias presented when using methods such as multilocus sequence typing, as the latter only samples a small fraction of the genome. </s><s n="s2.6;p28.29">The comparison of the whole genome is advantageous in that it allows for polymorphic loci to be identified, which can then be used for PCR-based sampling of variation within bacterial populations. </s><s n="s3.6;p28.29">Moreover, comparative genomic sequence is a valuable method because it can reveal novel, lineage-specific markers that enhance the resolution of genotyping schemes. </s><s n="s4.6;p28.29">For example, in the study of <hi rend="italic">B. anthracis</hi> by Read <hi rend="italic"> et al</hi>. </s><s n="s5.6;p28.29">(2002), eleven DNA sequence differences between the chromosomes of the Florida and Porton isolates were discovered. </s><s n="s6.6;p28.29">Solely by their VNTR profiles, these isolates would have been indistinguishable. </s></p><p n="p29.29"><s n="s1.6;p29.29">Another obvious value of comparing complete genome sequences is that the variances in gene content that may affect observed phenotypic differences in infectivity and virulence between closely related strains can be revealed. </s><s n="s2.6;p29.29">In addition, genes that have been deliberately introduced into bio warfare agents can be identified. </s><s n="s3.6;p29.29">These comparisons, however, can only be efficient with complete genomes, opposed to multiple, unordered assemblies of "draft" sequences. </s><s n="s4.6;p29.29">Hence, there is a necessity for the acquisition of accurate data to increase the span of databases. </s><s n="s5.6;p29.29">This means the construction of databases derived from genome-based surveys of natural variation in all major pathogens and not only potential biological warfare agents. </s><s n="s6.6;p29.29">(Read <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2002) The hope is that databases will increase in breadth and as a consequence more comparative studies will reveal important aspects involved in the virulence and infectivity of various pathogens that affect us.
