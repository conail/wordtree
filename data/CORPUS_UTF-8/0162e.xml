comparison. </s><s n="s3.6;p20.30">Also, for test normality, 4 data is far from enough to show normality, since a theorem ([2]) states that there should be at least 8 data all being on one side of the normal distribution that could prove nonnormality of the data points. </s><s n="s4.6;p20.30">QQ plot is also not so conclusive with only three or four data points distributed around the straight line. </s><s n="s5.6;p20.30">A suggestion is to take more observations over each sample, even though it is very expensive to repeat the experiment many times. </s><s n="s6.6;p20.30">There is tradeoff anyway, so we should consider the marginal gain of the statistical information with respect to the marginal price of doing more experiment, and find an optimal number of repeating. </s></p><p n="p21.30"><s n="s1.2;p21.30">An alternative way not to do so many t test for each pair of sample, we can do ANOVA to test the equality of all the mean of the control chip and the four strains for

n="s1.2;p25.30">Only when F statistic shows significantly difference between those k variables, can we then apply <hi rend="italic">t</hi> test to see which pair(s) of combination is(are) significantly different. </s><s n="s2.2;p25.30">Applying F test may save us a lot of time for our gene expression analysis, especially with multiple comparisons of different experiment results with the control. </s></p><p n="p26.30"><s n="s1.4;p26.30">We don't know whether we can do t test for this microarray, since the requirement for a t test is equal variance and normally distributed. </s><s

the reference paper ([1]), the number of significantly different gene expression is smaller in our test than that in the paper. </s><s n="s2.3;p27.30">This may due to different statistical software we
