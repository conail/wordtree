clear, immeasurable and contradictory. </s><s n="s4.5;p3.129">Because if we wish to maximize our profits, it means that we have to take some actions to control all kinds of cost, such as reduction of level of inventory which may lead to fail to satisfy customers demand. </s><s n="s5.5;p3.129">Taking into account the conditions in this game that a penalty is 12% of the sales value of

controllable factor. </s><s n="s5.8;p19.129">In fact, we only produced average 1500 units weekly by night shift in this four weeks, it can be totally replaced by Saturday shift plus evening shift which were more inexpensive and flexible. </s><s n="s6.8;p19.129">Another problem was stock value. </s><s n="s7.8;p19.129">In week 18, the value of stock was £595799, which meant that we not only spent much money for inventory cost, but also lost interests that we can earn from deposit account. </s><s n="s8.8;p19.129">So, our strategy in game level two was not successful, we lost a lot of

increase, holding cost grow but order costs decline. </s><s n="s2.4;p37.129">Before the point of EOQ, the decrease of order costs is greater than the increase of holding costs, so total cost fall.
