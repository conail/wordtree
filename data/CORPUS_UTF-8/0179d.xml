the creation of Weber's depersonalised 'legal rational' society, combined with the principles pioneered by entrepreneurs like Ford, create the political and social space for men to be so thoughtless, unengaged and alienated with the product of their labour, that when held accountable for the deaths of over six million European Jews, their answers are those that any factory worker might illicit, "I just load the trains", "I just cut their hair", "I just do as I'm told". </s><s n="s16.18;p5.6">This alienation from the product of labour, that is a fundamental trait of modernity, allows the disengagement from reality. </s><s n="s17.18;p5.6">The end product is never realised in the minds of the perpetrators. </s><s n="s18.18;p5.6">It is a grotesque paradox that a quarter of a century after men were yoked to the production line, that humanity should find itself on the same line progressing slowly towards the furnace at the end. </s></p><p n="p6.6"><s n="s1.14;p6.6">This however is not the whole story. </s><s n="s2.14;p6.6">Bauman is correct in his assessment of the means of the Holocaust, and I do not believe that Holocaust could happen in anything but a modern society. </s><s n="s3.14;p6.6">But the objective of the Holocaust was something completely irrational, and this makes it irreconcilable with modernity. </s><s n="s4.14;p6.6">Even as the allied tanks closed in on Berlin the 'deportation' of Jews continued, "The uselessness of the camps, their cynically admitted anti-utility, is only apparent" (Arendt:1973:456). </s><s n="s5.14;p6.6">Indeed the resources required to maintain the death camps meant that the rest of the German army was stretched beyond its limit: "Common sense trained in utilitarian thinking is helpless against this ideological supersense." </s><s n="s6.14;p6.6">(Arendt:1973:458), and is perhaps one of the reasons why the allies never chose to bomb the tracks that lead east. </s><s n="s7.14;p6.6">This self-cannibalism is something that for Arendt is implicit in totalitarian regimes, the totalitarian state is infact anti-state. </s><s n="s8.14;p6.6">Hitler came to power through the democratic process, and then proceeded to chisel away the institutions and principles of that democracy from the inside, the same paradigm is apparent in totalitarianism and the state, and the Holocaust and modernity. </s><s n="s9.14;p6.6">If we decide that the death camps are the fulfilment of an unknown prophecy foretold in the beginnings of the enlightenment we not only lose our innocence we lose hope. </s><s n="s10.14;p6.6">But equally the Holocaust should not merely become an evil out of time like some natural catastrophe. </s><s n="s11.14;p6.6">I do not think that there are any new principles, only new lessons to be learnt;
