with the legacy of the human rights violations committed within or outside South Africa between 1960, when the Sharpeville disaster took place, and the inauguration of Mr. Nelson Mandela as the first democratically-elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994. </s><s n="s2.2;p2.21">The process of expelling the ghosts of South Africa's tumultuous past required not only an attempt to right individual wrongs, but also that this be done in a manner that was not incompatible with the nation's peaceful entry into the new era, and the development of its fledgling democracy. </s></p><p n="p3.21"><s n="s1.5;p3.21">The situation under which the TRC was to work was certainly not devoid of constraints. </s><s n="s2.5;p3.21">As an institution, it cannot be denied that it had an important political role and presence, and it was a delicate task indeed to navigate the perilous path towards reconciliation in the midst of great political and socio-economic change, as the nation struggled to find its feet, and as its people became more self-aware. </s><s n="s3.5;p3.21">The colossal scale of the work it undertook in its short lifespan is in itself awe-inspiring. </s><s n="s4.5;p3.21">The TRC's task, according to the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, No 34 of 1995, was to broadly promote national unity and reconciliation in a spirit of understanding that transcended the conflicts and divisions of the past. </s><s n="s5.5;p3.21">It's aims, as summarized by Boraine, were to give back to victims their human rights, to restore moral order, to record the truth, to grant amnesty to those who qualified, to create a culture of human rights and respect for the rule of law and ultimately, by so doing, to prevent the recurrence of the violations of human rights of the past.<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.003"/> One can scarcely disagree that "The logistical problems alone of accomplishing such Herculean tasks in so large and diverse a country,

adhering to its aims, as set down in its mandate, it would be necessary to examine the impact of the work of the Commission as a whole, as well as that of its three committees, the Committee on Human Rights Violations, the Amnesty Committee, and the Reparations and Rehabilitations Committee. </s></p><p n="p5.21"><s n="s1.3;p5.21">The very breadth of the TRC's mandate almost necessitated a vast amount of criticism from various quarters, including legal challenges.<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.005"/> One of the most vociferous criticisms against the TRC was the charge that it has been overly lenient in its methods of bringing perpetrators to heel; many feel that amnesty was given too quickly and easily, in exchange for a mere recollection of one's story, and that this amounted to letting the perpetrators of gross human rights abuses roam free. </s><s n="s2.3;p5.21">However, as Boraine argues, individual amnesty was granted only in exchange for full disclosure, and was subject to a number of conditions, such as that the offence in question was politically motivated and committed under the auspices of a politically known entity. </s><s n="s3.3;p5.21">Thus, of the 7,000 individuals who applied, the commission recommended amnesty for only 1,200.<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.006"/> </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.005"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">In

methods by which the state may penalise criminal behaviour, at the core of which there is the much debated issue of which form of justice is 'most just'. </s><s n="s2.5;p11.21">It is interesting to note that where retributive justice, generally practiced by criminal justice systems, "begins ... with the notion of culpability and aims at a penalty, involving the infliction of stigmatising suffering upon the offender", restorative justice, on the other hand, "mainly directs its action towards the analysis of the damages caused by the offence upon the passive object of the crime (the victim) so that he/she is granted just reparation.".<ref target="BAWE_0186a-ftnote.016"/> In other words, where retributive justice regards crime as a violation of <hi rend="italic">the state and its
