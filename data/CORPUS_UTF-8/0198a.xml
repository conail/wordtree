removing any human error associated with the stopwatch. </s></p><p n="p92.100"><s n="s1.1;p92.100">To improve it even further; a robot can wind up the string and release the mass, to ensure that each

probably have the disc rotating from rest with a controlled constant acceleration up to a point where terminal velocity (measure the time taken to get from rest to terminal velocity), where past the terminal velocity, it would be unsafe. </s><s n="s3.3;p94.100">This Apparatus would be hard to construct, because to maintain acceleration, there would have to be a control/feedback mechanism.

friction being produced, or some sort of human error. </s></p><p n="p96.100"><s n="s1.1;p96.100">Using laser technology, you could place laser beams intermittent of the displacement, to plot the

n="s2.3;p97.100">Or investigate flywheels, modelling them as discs, and how the friction decreases with time and speed. </s><s n="s3.3;p97.100">You could also find the relationship between different radii of discs to the Moment of Inertia, the radius would have to be the only variable. </s></p><p n="p98.100"><s n="s1.1;p98.100">In further Experiments, consider using a more accurate rule, maybe a

of Interia are satisfactory, the level of error calculated is more than satisfactory to verify that the results are relatively accurate. </s><s n="s4.8;p99.100">As discussed before, it is mainly the error of the measuring rule that has increased the error value. </s><s n="s5.8;p99.100">This cannot be helped because no other source was available or indeed feasible at the time to measure lengths more accurately than a rule. </s><s n="s6.8;p99.100">If a strong recommendation was to be made, it would be to use a more accurate form of a rule (to improve results). </s><s n="s7.8;p99.100">This would be because of the small values for the Moment of Inertia in this experiment. </s><s n="s8.8;p99.100">It would be satisfactory if a rule of the same accuracy was used when there would be a high Moment of Inertia. </s></p><p n="p100.100"><s n="s1.1;p100.100">All results agree with previous discussed theories, i.e. the heavier the mass and larger the radius, the more the value for the Moment of Inertia. </s></p></div1></body><back><div1 type="bibliography"><head rend="underlined">8.0 References</head><p>Briefing sheet CRT October 2004 for Inertia Lab (see attached on page
