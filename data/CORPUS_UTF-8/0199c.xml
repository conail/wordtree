</s></p><p n="p3.15"><s n="s1.3;p3.15">Conjugation requires close contact between the recipient and the donor, which is obtained by the F pilus: this is synthesised by the donor, and is used to attach itself to the recipient to form a mating pair. </s><s n="s2.3;p3.15">Genetic material can then be transferred between the donor and the recipient through the pilus. </s><s n="s3.3;p3.15">Conjugative

shows the media E. coli was growing on) it can be deduced that the order of gene transfer was the following: Threonine, Proline, Leucine, Arginine, Isoleucine Valine, Xylose, Histidine, from start to end. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined">Discussion</head><p n="p10.15"><s n="s1.3;p10.15">These results were determined by comparing the colonies appearing at different times and observing which media the colonies were growing on. </s><s n="s2.3;p10.15">For example, in Pool 1, where Arginine is not included in the media, colony grow began after 30 minutes, which showed that the Arginine gene is transferred from the donor to the recipient after 30 minutes. </s><s n="s3.3;p10.15">The gene enabled the recipient to produce arginine, which was needed for protein synthesis, as arginine was not present in the media. </s></p><p n="p11.15"><s n="s1.1;p11.15">Isoleucine and Valine are transferred at the same time, as the production of these amino acids is encoded by the same gene (<hi rend="italic">ilv</hi>) </s></p><p n="p12.15"><s n="s1.4;p12.15">The results show some unexpected results: Proline was expected to be transferred on the chromosome first, but Threonine was the first gene to be transferred. </s><s n="s2.4;p12.15">Threonine also grew at 0 minutes, which is unexpected, as there should be no growth at this time as the bacteria are not adjusted to the growth conditions and would have only just begun to transfer the chromosome. </s><s n="s3.4;p12.15">This may be because Threonine is prone to point mutations and reversions. </s><s n="s4.4;p12.15">This can explain why Threonine appeared first because the triplets encoding Threonine and Proline can be very similar, so a point mutation could have occurred. </s></p><p n="p13.15"><s n="s1.1;p13.15">The conjugation mix was incubated in the static water bath to ensure the F pilus remained intact and the mating pairs were still in contact to transfer the genes by conjugation. </s></p><p n="p14.15"><s n="s1.1;p14.15">Nalidixic acid was included in the selective plates and the sample preparation salts medium to prevent further gene transfer between the donor and recipient, and to prevent the growth of the donor. </s></p><p n="p15.15"><s n="s1.2;p15.15">If nalidixic acid was not included, there would be growth on all of the plates, as the donor strain would be able to grow on the media. </s><s n="s2.2;p15.15">Also, gene transfer would continue. </s></p></div1></body><back><div1 type="bibliography"><head rend="underlined">References</head><p><seg type="URL"
