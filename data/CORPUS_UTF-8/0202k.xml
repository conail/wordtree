This may be contributing to workers not actually caring about their work. </s><s n="s3.6;p6.15">Furthermore, "research today has shown that in addition to monetary reward, today's workers require reinforcement of a sense of accomplishment in their jobs and the positive recognition that they are personally contributing to the achievement of company goals"<ref target="BAWE_0202k-ftnote.003"/>. </s><s n="s4.6;p6.15">There is clearly little empowerment within the firm. </s><s n="s5.6;p6.15">The new system of batch production is not helping this either, as this meant a more standardized production which reduces the skill required on the part of employee. </s><s n="s6.6;p6.15">Workers are unlikely to be happy with a move to a more unskilled type of labour as it reduces the amount of control they have on their output (as well as the satisfaction in producing output). </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0202k-ftnote.003"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Feigenbaum (1991:60) </s></p></note><p n="p7.15"><s n="s1.2;p7.15">Moreover, there is no communication within the firm emphasizing the need for quality consciousness, which would also help motivation as the standard worker would see that everyone is involved. </s><s n="s2.2;p7.15">There seems to be a lack of a quality standard within the firm as indicated by the senior shop foreman pointing to the fact that there was no definition of a scratch. </s></p><p n="p8.15"><s n="s1.6;p8.15">The disagreements between the production director and the senior shop foreman seem to indicate a lack of cohesiveness within the firm. </s><s n="s2.6;p8.15">The organization as a whole is not pulling in the same direction in order to reach a common goal, that of quality and therefore profit maximization. </s><s n="s3.6;p8.15">Whether the apparent stand off between the two is caused by this or a deeper disagreement is open to question, but there is no-doubt that the lack of cohesiveness can lead to disagreements and therefore affect the quality of the work and hence cause further disagreements, a kind of vicious circle. </s><s n="s4.6;p8.15">I notice that the quality assurance department only has responsibility for work leaving the final polishing process which is right at the end of the production process. </s><s n="s5.6;p8.15">By doing this they ignore the fact that a company does not just have external customers, it has internal customers too. </s><s n="s6.6;p8.15">This compounds disagreements and the lack of cohesiveness as no one knows who to blame for problems in quality coming to them. </s></p><p n="p9.15"><s n="s1.4;p9.15">Finally, there is clearly an emphasis on checking things AFTER they have gone through the system. </s><s n="s2.4;p9.15">Therefore there is not enough emphasis on getting things right first time. </s><s n="s3.4;p9.15">Moreover, the whole point of this exercise is detection. </s><s n="s4.4;p9.15">From my view there is not enough emphasis on prevention, which would allow quality savings. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head>3.</head><p n="p10.15"><s n="s1.1;p10.15">Looking at the problems identified in question two, it is clear that EHL has some serious underlying problems, particularly the whole company's attitude towards quality in general. </s></p><p n="p11.15"><s n="s1.7;p11.15">I would recommend a move to a Total Quality Management approach to quality to improve quality performance at EHL.
