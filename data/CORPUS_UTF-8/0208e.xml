Similarly, a lot of the prospective benefits of labour mobility have been curbed due to the restrictions imposed by most of member states (with the exception of the UK, Sweden and Denmark). </s><s n="s3.4;p6.20">Labour mobility is only one of the examples of non-tariff barriers and other impediments to free movement of goods, capital and services that still remain after the new entrants' arrival. </s><s n="s4.4;p6.20">This highlights the fact that perhaps not all of the Single Market's benefits are being fully reaped, thus deteriorating the advantages it offers in comparison to a FTA (this is particularly visible in the automobile and services industries, specially in financial services). </s></p><p n="p7.20"><s n="s1.4;p7.20">Supporters of this view would belittle the advantages of the Single Market, claiming the costs of its establishment and the financial commitments to the entering countries would outweigh the benefits. </s><s n="s2.4;p7.20">This seems to some authors, like Kok (2003), to be somewhat of myopic view of the enlargement's impact. </s><s n="s3.4;p7.20">The predicted increase in investment levels in new member states (due to the stability brought by their EU membership) is expected to bring out a high level of future economic growth in the Union, particularly if managed appropriately and if given the right conditions in which to thrive, such as a good system of national governance. </s><s n="s4.4;p7.20">The Single Market creates a much more appealing and investment environment due to the inherited political stability, which is not offered by a FTA. </s></p><p n="p8.20"><s n="s1.4;p8.20">Possibly some of the greatest benefits of Single Market entry, as opposed to a FTA, are those yielded by the common currency, an almost natural complement to the Single Market. </s><s n="s2.4;p8.20">The eagerness of the new members to adhere to it serves as illustration to this. </s><s n="s3.4;p8.20">In fact, all 10 nations are currently involved in negotiations and most have drawn up agreements<ref target="BAWE_0208e-ftnote.003"/> to prepare for future common currency implementation. </s><s n="s4.4;p8.20">Once the requirements for adhering to the common currency<ref target="BAWE_0208e-ftnote.004"/> are fulfilled, growth prospects are extremely favourable, through the lowering of uncertainty, elimination of transaction costs and increased

value of 60% of GDP), exchange rate stability (observance of the normal margins of the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS without severe tensions of devaluation for at least two years), and long term interest rates (may not exceed by more than 2 percentage points that of the three best performing countries in terms of price stability). </s><s n="s2.2;pn1.1">The Treaty also requires an examination

specifically to new entrants seem more obvious and appear to outweigh those in a FTA, as it involves bringing structural funds to these economically less advanced nations, allowing them to get up to speed with the rest of the member states<ref target="BAWE_0208e-ftnote.005"/>. </s><s n="s2.3;p9.20">For the E15 members however, these benefits only emerge in the long run, but appear amply supported
