(1994) have indicated this means forecasting via "intelligent" consultation so as to maximise inputs from "rich" marketplace insider sources. </s><s n="s3.4;p57.62">Mason-Jones and Towill (1997) argue that "information enrichment", i.e. immediate sharing of marketplace data throughout the chain is not merely desirable, but obligatory. </s><s n="s4.4;p57.62">This must be achieved in a process integration scenario as we move towards the Seamless Supply Chain (SSC) in which all "players" think and act as one (Towill, 1997). </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="bold">The personal computer supply chain</head><p n="p58.62"><s n="s1.6;p58.62">The challenge to supply chain management is to seek to develop "lean" strategies up to the material decoupling point but "agile" strategies beyond that point. </s><s n="s2.6;p58.62">In other words by using generic or modular inventory to postpone the final commitment it should be possible to achieve volume-oriented economies of scale through product standardisation. </s><s n="s3.6;p58.62">The flow of product up to the decoupling point may well be forecast driven; after the decoupling point it should be demand driven. </s><s n="s4.6;p58.62">A good practical example is to be found in the PC supply chain. </s><s n="s5.6;p58.62">This has been well documented during its various phases of development, including the Hewlett-Packard (Lee and Sasser, 1995; Davies, 1993), IBM (Beal, 1988; Laurent, 1992) and Dell (Dell and Fedman, 1999) supply chains. </s><s n="s6.6;p58.62">Relevant generic models describing dynamic behaviour according to the various stages of re-engineering such PC supply chains have also been verified (Hiebeler et al., 1998). </s></p><p n="p59.62"><s n="s1.11;p59.62">Dell in particular has become the master of the vertical distribution channel by being the sole distributor of its products and services (Dell and Fedman, 1999). </s><s n="s2.11;p59.62">A customer initiates the sales process by contacting the company via telephone or the Internet. </s><s n="s3.11;p59.62">There are three ways of selling: face-to-face; ear-to-ear; and keyboard-to-server. </s><s n="s4.11;p59.62">A customer can order from Dell on-line 24 hours a day or by phone from early morning until late in the evening. </s><s n="s5.11;p59.62">A Dell representative is available to make suggestions and help customers determine what systems will best meet their needs. </s><s n="s6.11;p59.62">Through the Web site, customers can access product information and receive price estimates instantaneously. </s><s n="s7.11;p59.62">Dell then confirms the order and verifies the financial credit charge. </s><s n="s8.11;p59.62">Usually the representative promises that the computer will arrive within five business days although the customer often receives the product quicker than this. </s><s n="s9.11;p59.62">The Dell factory receives a printout of the order and begins manufacturing within hours. </s><s n="s10.11;p59.62">Each computer is customer-built and put through several hardware and software tests in less than one day. </s><s n="s11.11;p59.62">After a final inspection the computer is boxed by Dell and sent to a distribution centre that ships it by carrier in time to arrive with a monitor that is built ahead of time by a separate supplier. </s></p><p n="p60.62"><s n="s1.10;p60.62">Thus customer orders are satisfied by an agile execution-based, direct model driven business operation without any finished inventory. </s><s n="s2.10;p60.62">One way Dell Computer beats its competitors on prices is by also keeping component inventories to a minimum. </s><s n="s3.10;p60.62">Vertical integration has helped the company further reduce costs. </s><s n="s4.10;p60.62">Monitors, for example, are relatively standardised and built by an agile supplier. </s><s n="s5.10;p60.62">So today Dell may need as many as 8,752 monitors from the suppliers; tomorrow they might need as few as 962. </s><s n="s6.10;p60.62">One of their carriers simply picks the monitors up at night, matches them up with the PCs by purchase order, and the next day delivers them to the customers. </s><s n="s7.10;p60.62">The rule on working with suppliers is to keep it simple, with fewer than 40 vendors providing 90 per cent of material needs. </s><s n="s8.10;p60.62">This justifies close working relationships and reduced cost and further speeds up new products to market. </s><s n="s9.10;p60.62">A financial analysis showed that "supplier proximity pays". </s><s n="s10.10;p60.62">Hence as Dell became a global manufacturer their preferred suppliers were expected to follow suit. </s></p><p n="p61.62"><s n="s1.6;p61.62">Fast feedback from customers' enables Dell suppliers to rapidly change product mix and maintain their inventory velocity. </s><s n="s2.6;p61.62">To make the required breakthrough on supply strategy, Dell shares its goals and objectives with suppliers. </s><s n="s3.6;p61.62">By shipping as required (hourly or daily depending on the product), Dell has bought more components and assemblies from the suppliers faster and paid them quicker, so everyone benefits. </s><s n="s4.6;p61.62">The company has totally integrated the distribution channel by clearly identifying its markets and by designing products and services to fit the needs of its customers. </s><s n="s5.6;p61.62">Hence the direct contact with customers gives Dell minute-by-minute input from the largest customer down to the individual purchaser in terms of what products they want and what new services they would like to see Dell develop. </s><s n="s6.6;p61.62">This information on present demand and future requirements is shared with Dell suppliers in a real-world example of effective supply chain partnering and is a key enabler in achieving agility. </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="bold">Conclusions</head><p n="p62.62"><s n="s1.9;p62.62">The lean paradigm requires that "fat" be eliminated. </s><s n="s2.9;p62.62">However the agile paradigm must be "nimble" since sales lost are gone forever. </s><s n="s3.9;p62.62">An important difference is that lean supply is associated with level scheduling, whereas agile supply means reserving capacity to cope with volatile demand. </s><s n="s4.9;p62.62">Whereas information transparency is desirable in a lean regime, it is obligatory for agility. </s><s n="s5.9;p62.62">Lean forecasting is algorithmic, but agile forecasting requires shared information on current demand captured as close to the marketplace as possible. </s><s n="s6.9;p62.62">Real world supply chains are cyclical in character. </s><s n="s7.9;p62.62">This means that this year's market winner is next year's market qualifier. </s><s n="s8.9;p62.62">Hence lean chains are under pressure to become agile, and in some markets, such as the personal computer, further pressure to become customised. </s><s n="s9.9;p62.62">As we have seen from the migratory model, the challenges during each transition are significantly different. </s></p></div2></div1></body><back><div1 type="bibliography"><head rend="bold italic">REFERENCE</head><p>Austin, T.
