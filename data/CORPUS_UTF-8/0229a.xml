which, as Peter Childs argues, was 'primarily located in the years 1890-1930',<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.002"/> then there are many notable developments which took place in Germany during this

women were no longer confined to the roles of housewife and mother imposed on them by the former Imperial state.<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.006"/> Indeed, Weimar Germany embraced the presence of both low and high culture, just as it questioned the hierarchy inherent in the German marriage, as Theodor Van der Velde's guide to marriage, <hi rend="underlined">Die volkommene Ehe</hi>, testifies<ref target="BAWE_0229a-ftnote.007"/>. </s><s n="s10.11;p1.16">In contrast to the artistically dubious cabaret, several creative movements, some essentially part of Modernism, others in
