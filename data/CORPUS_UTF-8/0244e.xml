the working population and industrialisation occurred much more slowly. </s><s n="s3.6;p11.12">But this was not the case of Germany or Great Britain; in the European cities where factory workers were numerous and outnumbered the artisans there was more chance of a class consciousness rising amongst the proletariat. </s><s n="s4.6;p11.12">This did not tend to happen however as there was no culture

factories and so there was no time to forge strong friendships or bonds. </s><s n="s6.6;p11.12">This high turnover also meant that if workers were to go on strike then they could easily be replaced

with the advent of industrialisation. </s><s n="s3.5;p12.12">They had the social means and tradition of coming together to face adversity and the period before 1870 was the time when they feared changes the most. </s><s n="s4.5;p12.12">After this they may have realised that it was probably too late to return to their preferred way of life and it was left up to the vast number of factory workers to fight for better living and working conditions. </s><s n="s5.5;p12.12">Moreover, following this period, the ideas of socialism and a class consciousness had had time to take hold in the proletariat and they were inclined to organise strikes and similar activities. </s></p></div1></body><back/></text></TEI.2>
