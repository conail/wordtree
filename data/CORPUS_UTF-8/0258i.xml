Both of us in this project worked as a team which made it possible to complete the project to our full satisfaction. 
None of us had more or less contribution in the project. 
Both of us worked hard towards the project and also this project helped us to clear more of our concepts in Digital Input and Output. 
With team spirit we were able to complete our project as both of us use to have opinions on different sub parts of the program and then deciding which suited the specification the best was implemented in the program.
