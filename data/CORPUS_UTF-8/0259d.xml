that one's values, goals, bias, interpretations, or <hi rend="italic">perspective</hi> are all necessary for, rather than impediments to, knowledge. </s><s n="s2.8;p2.23">In maintaining this, Nietzsche stands opposed to all those philosophers whose theory of knowledge holds up disinterested and value-free as true knowledge's chief virtues. </s><s n="s3.8;p2.23">For him, the intellect is not an impersonal faculty that seeks out those truths that exist independently of the knower, but is tied intimately to the drives, needs, and instincts of the human animal. </s><s n="s4.8;p2.23">The intellect is put into action in service of the desires of the dominant will of its owner - what Nietzsche calls their <hi rend="italic">will to power</hi>.<ref target="BAWE_0259d-ftnote.002"/> Thus

knowledge which each acquires, as though before the application of such a perspective the thing known <hi rend="italic">does</hi> have a way of existing 'in itself', as though perspective was most accurately thought of as a measure of distortion. </s><s n="s6.8;p2.23">Perspective does not simply re-orientate already perceived moments into a more satisfying way of seeing; it is perspective which constitutes the very act of perception itself. </s><s n="s7.8;p2.23">In other words, to perceive is necessarily to perceive <hi rend="italic">as</hi> something; to know is necessarily to know <hi

perspectivism being one of them. </s><s n="s3.14;p4.23">It only makes sense to assume that he presents such views as the eternal return, the will to power, or the corruption of Christianity in some degree of seriousness. </s><s n="s4.14;p4.23">That is to say, Nietzsche must write what he does because he thinks that his views are (to use an equivocal and volatile word), true. </s><s n="s5.14;p4.23">Not only that, but the fact <hi rend="italic">that he writes at all</hi> would seem to suggest that the dissemination of his views, thereby taking on the role of teacher, is part of his goal. </s><s n="s6.14;p4.23">The question that must be asked in light of this is the following: if Nietzsche does take his own views to be true, then how is this consistent with his perspectivism? </s><s n="s7.14;p4.23">If every view is only an interpretation, then must this not apply to his views as well? </s><s n="s8.14;p4.23">Does he not thereby effectively undermine his authority as a physician of culture? </s><s n="s9.14;p4.23">If, on the contrary, he does not take his views to be true, then we are faced with a more perplexing question: why did he bother to write at all? </s><s n="s10.14;p4.23">While this paradox arises out of the recognition that the tenet of perspectivism ought to apply to the writer espousing it, the second paradox focuses on the result of perspectivism turning on itself as a doctrine. </s><s n="s11.14;p4.23">The problem is straightforward: if perspectivism is correct, then every view is indeed an interpretation, since disinterested objective truths are a fiction. </s><s n="s12.14;p4.23">If every view is an interpretation, then perspectivism <hi rend="italic">itself</hi> is an interpretation, meaning that it stands alongside many other possible and diverse interpretations. </s><s n="s13.14;p4.23">Thus, perspectivism is possibly incorrect, and every view is perhaps not an interpretation. </s><s n="s14.14;p4.23">The position would seem to undermine itself. </s></p><p n="p5.23"><s n="s1.4;p5.23">I do not think it is immediately obvious which of these two problems it is more important to address, if in fact they are not equally important. </s><s n="s2.4;p5.23">One could argue in favour of the former by insisting that rigorous logical consistency, such as that which is the subject of the second paradox, is not a law which Nietzsche obeyed, nor had any respect for. </s><s n="s3.4;p5.23">Thus the more practical issue of his role as a teacher that teaches every truth is only <hi rend="italic">my</hi> truth takes

n="s5.7;p9.23">Rather than addressing the issue <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the content of his works, he addresses it <hi rend="italic">via</hi> the form. </s><s n="s6.7;p9.23">First, we will see how Nietzsche's execution of his <hi rend="italic">Genealogy of Morals</hi> not only reveals the interpretations that are intimately involved in moral 'truths', but also, through his style, is able to draw attention to and undermine his own authority as the genealogist. </s><s n="s7.7;p9.23">Second, by taking note of the pluralism Nietzsche exhibits in the style of his presentation and the rhetorical tropes he employs, we will see how he creates for himself an unforgettably <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> presence in his works, thereby conveying how necessarily individual are their contents. </s></p><p n="p10.23"><s n="s1.6;p10.23">In the preface and three essays that comprise his <hi rend="italic">On the Genealogy of Morals</hi>, Nietzsche presents an account of the origin of the accepted moral standards that exist today, revealing the values, desires, and beliefs which were responsible for generating such standards. </s><s n="s2.6;p10.23">By using genealogy as his method, he uncovers the line of descent extending from 'ancestral' psychological states to the current system of morality. </s><s n="s3.6;p10.23">In this way, Nietzsche seeks not so much to examine the veracity of a moral truth to which society holds fast, but rather undertakes a project to expose the will that led to such a moral 'truth'. </s><s n="s4.6;p10.23">The focus is less on a logical analysis of the content of the ideas and more on uncovering the motivation behind those who espouse such ideas. </s><s n="s5.6;p10.23">This is not to say that arguments against the idea itself are not offered - for these are not omitted - but rather that the perspective from which such 'truth' springs is for him a more fundamental inquiry. </s><s n="s6.6;p10.23">For this perspective that he is so eager to bring to the surface comes logically and temporally in advance of the established 'truth'; thus the analysis that asks after motivation is one that is able to go deeper. </s></p><p n="p11.23"><s n="s1.9;p11.23">With his target set as Christian morality, he provides an account of how the current virtues of meekness, humility, justice, and forgiveness, all elements of what Nietzsche deems the slave morality, came to be known as the values which one ought to prize as good. </s><s n="s2.9;p11.23">In uncovering the etymological roots of the word 'good', he finds an opposing conception of morality than the one that persists now. </s><s n="s3.9;p11.23">'Good', he argues, used to be a measure of status or hierarchical position. </s><s n="s4.9;p11.23">In ancient

the clever slave devalues the values held by oppressors and making what opposes it what is valuable. </s><s n="s8.9;p11.23">This hostile reaction rejects the values of the noblemen, characterizing them as evil qualities, while championing their impotence as meekness, their desire for revenge as justice, and their incapacity for revenge as humility. </s><s n="s9.9;p11.23">Driven by his hatred for his master, he negates the master's values and creates a morality for which it is good to be weak, so that he thereby can be on one level victorious against the master. </s></p><p n="p12.23"><s n="s1.5;p12.23">These values, rooted in reaction and resentment, are what Nietzsche argues to be the same that persist in Christian morality today. </s><s n="s2.5;p12.23">And, because it can only be

</s><s n="s3.5;p12.23">What Nietzsche aims to make clear is that Christian morality arises not from love and forgiveness, but guilt and resentment. </s><s n="s4.5;p12.23">What is also made clear, through the method of genealogy itself, is that even perhaps our most tacitly accepted 'truths' are far from objective or unconditional, and are instead always informed by certain motivations, by a certain <hi rend="italic">perspective</hi>. </s><s n="s5.5;p12.23">In addition, those hidden motivations are inextricably tied to what they produce, and are therefore relevant when it comes to evaluating or providing a critique of current 'truths'. </s></p><p n="p13.23"><s n="s1.6;p13.23">However, while genealogy as a method of inquiry animates the very idea of perspectivism, while it reveals the interpretation behind the idea, it is at the same time an exercise in interpretation and evaluation itself. </s><s n="s2.6;p13.23">For of course the account provided by Nietzsche of the roots of Christian morality is not the presentation of an unconditional fact (as he opposes the very idea of such facts), but is <hi rend="italic">his</hi> interpretation. </s><s n="s3.6;p13.23">The account must be irreducibly personal, as his preferences are put to use: "to interpret as a psychologist is to evaluate, according to its strength or weakness, the quality of the will required by an
