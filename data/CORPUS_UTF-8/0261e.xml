relatives may mourn the loss of the individual but have to come to terms with the bereavement. </s><s n="s3.11;p1.9">This can be facilitated through a funeral service as it provides the mourners last chance to say farewell to their beloved and marks a closed chapter of the person life. </s><s n="s4.11;p1.9">But how does a nation come to terms with loss? </s><s n="s5.11;p1.9">The Second World War has been claimed to be the darkest periods for the history of humanity due to the extreme number of casualties, which have been estimated at 62 million.<ref target="BAWE_0261e-ftnote.001"/> This is undoubtedly an unprecedented figure. </s><s n="s6.11;p1.9">The war consumed civilians, military personnel, landscapes and cites whilst the aftermath can still be felt today. </s><s n="s7.11;p1.9">The end of the war in May 1945 marked a distinct turning point as the survivors befell victim to psychological trauma which resulted in a collective trauma for European societies. </s><s n="s8.11;p1.9">The consequences can be seen in the search for Nazi's as scapegoats, the creation of various conspiracy theories about Allied-Nazi agreements, the destruction of group identity as with the Ukrainians. </s><s n="s9.11;p1.9">But it can also play a key role in formation of new identities such as for the Jews or Poles. </s><s n="s10.11;p1.9">For a nation to face up to the tragedy, providing meaning for it, shapes the experience of collective trauma and facilitates the nation's recovery. </s><s n="s11.11;p1.9">Thus the form of remembering the dead, the "cult of the dead", serves to provide support to the bereaved, meaning of the dead and a justification of the sacrifice, thus ultimately legitimising the existence of the nation and the political system. </s></p><note

aims to examine in political terms the importance of cult of the dead and how significant it is the nation building process. </s><s n="s2.2;p2.9">Through the narrative of the situation of post Second World War Poland, this essay shall examine the tools used by the newly established communist regime and assess its success of using the political cult of the dead as a means of legitimising its authority. </s></p><p n="p3.9"><s n="s1.9;p3.9">For the Polish nation, the Second World War has been one of the most traumatic experiences any nation has had to endure, it lost 15% of its population, of which were mostly civilians, who were either exterminated by the Nazi or Soviet terror. </s><s n="s2.9;p3.9">Statistics claim that 3 million Polish Jews were murdered by the Nazis, whilst a remaining 2.5 million died as a result of Soviet occupation from September 1939 and the mass deportations to Siberia. </s><s n="s3.9;p3.9">The Polish population was massacred in Volhynia by the Ukrainians, the failed Warsaw Uprising left the city in rumble and most of the officers' elite were wiped out in the Katyn massacres. </s><s n="s4.9;p3.9">From the military perspective, after the fall of Poland in October 1939, the Poles set up a resistance movement <hi rend="italic">Armia Krajowa</hi>, which continued to destabilise the Nazi occupation. </s><s n="s5.9;p3.9">Numerous Polish individuals fought in the air, at sea, on land and by 1944 on all fronts; Western, Eastern and Southern. </s><s n="s6.9;p3.9">Furthermore their input was at times most crucial as the Squadron 300 and 303 defended the British skies during the battle of Britain, the breaking of the enigma by Polish mathematicians enabled the allies to decode German messages and the 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Polish division opened the route to Rome at the battle of Monte Cassino in 1944. </s><s n="s7.9;p3.9">Poland was the first nation to be attacked in 1939 and it held out throughout the entire war on the Allies side. </s><s n="s8.9;p3.9">However at the Conference of Yalta the nation was betrayed by its Western Allies as Soviet domination was allowed with the establishment of the People's Republic of Poland. </s><s n="s9.9;p3.9">How could one provide meaning for such national suffering and justify the display of heroic valence which resulted in a tragic outcome? </s></p><p n="p4.9"><s n="s1.11;p4.9">The first major issue the communist party had to tackle was the memory of the sufferings inflicted by the Soviets, however this proved to be an extreme challenge. </s><s n="s2.11;p4.9">There was a deep rooted Russo-phobic sentiment that reached even further than the first partition of Poland in 1773, and which was reinforced by the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920 alongside the constant anti-communist stance throughout the pre-war period. </s><s n="s3.11;p4.9">Therefore the memory of the war had to be readjusted in a manner to suite the communist party; as in an authoritarian regime individual memories are censored. </s><s n="s4.11;p4.9">As the American scholar, Catherine Merridale states, "personal memory is only part of the social of remembering, so it may appear irrelevant or even subversive to national projects of commemoration." </s><ref target="BAWE_0261e-ftnote.002"/><s n="s5.11;p4.9">Hence in light of the atrocities committed by the Nazis and the "liberation" from the occupation by the Soviets, the latter were viewed as the saviours. </s><s n="s6.11;p4.9">The crimes of the Nazi's were broadcasted constantly; the trials at Nuremburg transfixed the Polish nation as they sought revenge for the inhumane suffering. </s><s n="s7.11;p4.9">Landmarks such the Warsaw Ghetto, Auschwitz and Paviak<ref target="BAWE_0261e-ftnote.003"/> became historical monuments to "victims of Nazi aggression", whilst relics of the Warsaw uprising were removed. </s><s n="s8.11;p4.9">The use of military metaphors and the language of heroism in party statements and media served as another means of depicting the Germans as almost lesser humans. </s><s n="s9.11;p4.9">Thus by default, this promoted the valence of the Soviet army, which was naturally incensed by them belonging to the Victors, the Allies. </s><s n="s10.11;p4.9">The communist's did not need to strengthen in particular the anti-German sentiments as Polish communities gathered together and forced many Germans out of the newly acquired lands, as it has been estimated that approximately 3 million Germans were 'evicted'. </s><s n="s11.11;p4.9">Thus clearly the "iteration of one kind of memory involves the forgetting of others,"<ref target="BAWE_0261e-ftnote.004"/> as all the deaths of the war were blamed directly on the Nazis, even those which arose from disease and malnutrition. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0261e-ftnote.002"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Catherine Merridale, "War, death and remembrance in Soviet Russia" in Winter J. and Sivan E., (ed)

n="s1.8;p5.9">The suppression of information and knowledge on the evils conducted by the Soviets was performed by re-interpretation, 'hushing up' and actual banning. </s><s n="s2.8;p5.9">The Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939 was claimed to have been agreed with the Polish Government, whilst the Katyn crime was blamed on the Nazis, furthermore the lack of international support for the case only enhanced the communist position by providing greater mystification on the culprit.<ref target="BAWE_0261e-ftnote.005"/> Polish history textbooks avoided similar "case sensitive" issues such as the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact and "the memory of Poland's role in all those aspects of the Allied Victory not directly connected with the Soviet camp was systematically erased from the record." </s><ref target="BAWE_0261e-ftnote.006"/><s n="s3.8;p5.9">Teachers caught mentioning national Polish heroes such as General Władysław Anders or Władysław Sikorski were simply imprisoned and the curriculum imposed the glorification of 'Moscow' Polish communists such as Wanda Wasilewska and General Bering. </s><s n="s4.8;p5.9">War memorials and cemeteries to commemorate the Soviet soldier's achievements and sacrifices of 1944-45 were erected in almost every Polish city, whilst "gravestones, obituaries, notices making any reference to the Polish government, the Home Army or to any foreign service were [...] removed by agents of the state police." </s><ref target="BAWE_0261e-ftnote.007"/><s n="s5.8;p5.9">The state sponsored commemoration aimed to rewrite the national story by inventing tradition where the past was overshadowed, as the replacement of the 3 <hi rend="sup">rd</hi> May National Day commemoration with that of 22 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> July, recalling the creation of the Lublin government in 1944. </s><s n="s6.8;p5.9">Clearly meaning of death and suffering was not provided to all, as the state selected the deaths of those who died for the communist cause and used them as a means of legitimising its authority. </s><s n="s7.8;p5.9">Offering meaning inspired the principles of patriotism as significance and emotion could be attached to the sacrifice which corresponded to the needs of the population who sought a measure of coming to terms with the tragedy. </s><s n="s8.8;p5.9">By limiting the process of me-moralization to a selected group little comfort to the bereaved could be offered but this in turn stimulated a direct response anti-communist communities such as the Church and the Polish émigrés. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0261e-ftnote.005"><p

able to partially provide consolidation moreover the historic attachment of the institution to the Polish nation building process, paved the way for the nationalisation of religious meaning of death. </s><s n="s2.8;p6.9">The language of the consolidation in light of Christian idealism generalised the sacrifice of the dead to incorporate the sacrifice of the bereaved thus redemption was achieved via a supreme sacrifice.<ref target="BAWE_0261e-ftnote.008"/> Furthermore due to the legacy of the Catholic Church as the moral authority for the Polish nation and as a beacon of preserving national identity, it used the popular belief of <hi rend="italic">mesjanizm</hi> as a manner of justifying the suffering. </s><s n="s3.8;p6.9">The metaphysical concept which emerged during the partitions ascribed the Poles with a messianic mission of "suffering innocently in order to redeem humankind"<ref target="BAWE_0261e-ftnote.009"/>. </s><s n="s4.8;p6.9">This principle was upheld by the communists partially since it weakened opposition but more importantly served as manner of unifying the Polish nation together, similar to monument of the Unknown Soldier. </s><s n="s5.8;p6.9">However the conviction exposed tensions with minorities living in Poland as the Jews were omitted in the notion and the stereotype of the Polish-Catholic was inflamed. </s><s n="s6.8;p6.9">Despite the
