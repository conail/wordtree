three variants were produced: one to allow the buggy to follow a square track - alternately clockwise and anticlockwise - one to allow it to follow a maze track and one to allow it to follow any other suitably marked track. </s><s n="s3.3;p1.36">The system performed excellently in all cases, following the track accurately and searching efficiently when the track was lost. </s></p><figure

on the above and our knowledge of the buggy, it is possible to expand a little on how the software should be implemented. </s><s n="s2.3;p3.36">For example, if the track is lost at any point, the buggy should 'scan' to find the track again. </s><s n="s3.3;p3.36">Also, if the track is not found during this scan, the buggy should move forwards and scan again until the track is found. </s></p><p n="p4.36"><s n="s1.3;p4.36">After accomplishing the task of writing software to fit the above specification, two further adaptations of the specification were produced to give a total of three slightly different specifications, each applicable to a different type of board. </s><s n="s2.3;p4.36">The above specification produced a piece of software which allows the buggy to run on any board marked out in a suitable width of black tape on a white background with gaps at junctions. </s><s n="s3.3;p4.36">A further specification allows the buggy to run on a square board and another allows it to run on a maze board, as described below. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_0263g-pic.002"><head rend="bold">Photograph and diagram of the general board</head></figure></div2><div2><head rend="bold">Square Specification:</head><p n="p5.36"><s rend="italic" n="s1.2;p5.36"> The objective is to write software that controls a mobile buggy robot, enabling it to follow an optically marked track in the shape of a square with gaps at the corners. </s><s rend="italic" n="s2.2;p5.36">After completing a circuit of the board, the robot should turn round and follow the track in the opposite direction. </s></p><p n="p6.36"><s n="s1.4;p6.36">As before, if the track is lost, the buggy should scan to find the track again. </s><s n="s2.4;p6.36">If the track is not found during this scan (i.e. the buggy is at a corner) a 'corner counter' should be incremented and the buggy should move forwards and scan again to find the track. </s><s n="s3.4;p6.36">Note that the distance the buggy moves will be dictated by the size of the gaps in the board. </s><s n="s4.4;p6.36">If the corner counter is divisible by 4 (i.e. the buggy has passed a multiple of 4 corners and has therefore just completed a circuit), the buggy should rotate round through about 180° until it finds the track again and should continue following the track in the opposite direction (i.e. if it was traveling clockwise, it should turn and follow the track anticlockwise). </s></p><figure id="BAWE_0263g-pic.003"><head rend="bold">Photograph and diagram of the square board</head></figure></div2><div2><head rend="bold">Maze Specification:</head><p n="p7.36"><s rend="italic" n="s1.1;p7.36"> The objective is to write software that controls a mobile buggy robot, enabling it to follow an optically marked maze track by following the left wall. </s></p><p n="p8.36"><s n="s1.4;p8.36">Again, if the track is lost, the buggy should scan to find the track. </s><s n="s2.4;p8.36">If the track is not found during this scan (i.e. the buggy is at a junction or dead end), it must use a 'left wall following' algorithm. </s><s n="s3.4;p8.36">It must first check to see if there is a track at 90° to its left; if not then it checks 90° to the right of this, then 90° to the right of this and finally 90° to the right of this, returning it to the original track and sending it back in the direction it came from (i.e. having reached a dead end, the buggy backtracks). </s><s n="s4.4;p8.36">Using this algorithm allows it to solve a maze providing there are no loops within the maze. </s></p><figure

designed and implemented. </s><s n="s2.3;p9.36">Each board was designed then implemented before moving on to the design for the next board. </s><s n="s3.3;p9.36">This allowed techniques learnt during the implementation of one board to be applied to the design of the software for the next type of board. </s></p><p n="p10.36"><s n="s1.6;p10.36">For the general specification, two basic functions were required: movement and detection. </s><s n="s2.6;p10.36">Movement covers motion in all required directions (i.e. forwards, left, right and backwards). </s><s n="s3.6;p10.36">A combination of movements was required to follow the track, scan for the track when lost and react to the result of a scan. </s><s n="s4.6;p10.36">Detection covers detecting when the paths has been lost and when the path has been found during a scan. </s><s n="s5.6;p10.36">From these basic functions, it was possible to create a general method for following a track. </s><s n="s6.6;p10.36">Here, x denotes a variable whose

n="s2.2;p12.36">These methods, however, were found to be trivial (i.e. can be done in just one or two lines of code) so separate methods were not designed or implemented. </s></p><p n="p13.36"><s n="s1.2;p13.36">On top of the methods described above, code was required to define the VIA and to declare and initialise global variables. </s><s n="s2.2;p13.36">This was included at the beginning of the code and was similar to the code at the beginning of buggytimertest.c. </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="bold">Square Board Software:</head><p n="p14.36"><s n="s1.2;p14.36">In addition to the methods described above, a corner counter was needed to keep track of how many corners had been passed and a method to reverse the direction of travel. </s><s n="s2.2;p14.36">These additional

was equivalent to counting failed sweeps, greatly simplifying both design and implementation for the square board method. </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="bold">Maze Board Software:</head><p n="p16.36"><s n="s1.5;p16.36">The intended algorithm for using the buggy to solve a maze was a 'left wall follower'. </s><s n="s2.5;p16.36">The main reasons for this choice were that it is a nice simple way of solving a maze and also that some previous work with this algorithm had been done in another programming module (CS118). </s><s n="s3.5;p16.36">The principle is that by imagining the tracks to have 'walls' on the left and right, following round one of the walls (in this case the left one) allows the buggy eventually to get to the end of the maze. </s><s n="s4.5;p16.36">Unfortunately there was not enough time to develop a way of marking the end of the maze and making the buggy stop when it reached the end. </s><s n="s5.5;p16.36">However, the algorithm was designed and implemented to enable the buggy to follow the maze indefinitely, eventually exploring the whole of the maze. </s></p><list type="ordered"><head>Maze solving/following

rend="bold">Preliminary Software Stage:</head><p n="p18.36"><s n="s1.4;p18.36">Before beginning the actual coding of the software, it was important to understand how the sample code worked, and to ensure the buggy was functioning correctly. </s><s n="s2.4;p18.36">The tester program was loaded into the SWET and executed (exact details of how this was done can be found in Appendix A). </s><s n="s3.4;p18.36">The buggy functioned correctly so the buggytimertest.c code was compiled, loaded and executed. </s><s n="s4.4;p18.36">Watching the buggy's actions, examining the code and reading the accompanying lab sheet (see Appendix A) made it easy to see which lines did what. </s></p><p n="p19.36"><s n="s1.5;p19.36">The next stage was deciding which method of driving the motors was best: signalling the motor drive pulse controls or using the timer. </s><s n="s2.5;p19.36">Code was copied from buggytimertest.c to develop two short programs which moved the buggy in all directions. </s><s n="s3.5;p19.36">There was a small problem at this stage as the buggy was making strange grinding noises as it moved, which hadn't happened when the test program was run. </s><s n="s4.5;p19.36">It was discovered that this was due to the fact that the delay between pulsing the motors was too short so they were slipping; simply making the delay a little longer sorted this problem. </s><s n="s5.5;p19.36">Having sorted this problem, it was decided that the best way to drive the buggy was to use the timer. </s></p><p n="p20.36"><s n="s1.3;p20.36">During the testing, it was also discovered that simply pulsing the left or right motor was not a very good way of turning and resulted in a very large turning circle for the buggy. </s><s n="s2.3;p20.36">However, rotating one motor clockwise and the other anticlockwise provided a much tighter turning circle - the buggy pivots about the centre of its back end, rather than a wheel. </s><s n="s3.3;p20.36">This discovery was duly noted and this method was used throughout when rotation was required. </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="bold">General Board Software:</head><p n="p21.36"><s n="s1.5;p21.36">Having done the above preliminary work to understand how the buggy worked, coding of the actual software could begin. </s><s n="s2.5;p21.36">The first stage of implementation was setting up the signals on the VIA. This task was relatively simple as the sample file buggytimertest.c required very similar signals to be set up so the project software was based on this. </s><s n="s3.5;p21.36">Global variables were also declared at the beginning of the code along with the delay method. </s><s n="s4.5;p21.36">The main method was implemented next. </s><s n="s5.5;p21.36">This sets bits on the VIA appropriately, makes the timer generate a drive pulse for the motors and calls the method which allows the buggy to follow the track, move. </s></p><p n="p22.36"><s n="s1.3;p22.36">These lines of code (which can be seen in Appendix B) were then tested together by defining a simple move method. </s><s n="s2.3;p22.36">Copying from the (already tested) buggytimertest.c program allowed the creation of a move method which simply makes the buggy move forward. </s><s n="s3.3;p22.36">An additional delay method was also required, which was copied from buggytimertest.c too. </s></p><quote lang="English">int move(void) { *VIA_ORA = 0x30; delay(DELAY); } void delay(int length) { volatile int i; for (i=0; i &lt; length; i++) {}; }</quote><p n="p23.36"><s n="s1.4;p23.36">Having put these methods together in order, the program was compiled then loaded into the SWET.
