the former being the more contemporarily prevalent. </s><s n="s2.3;p1.12">In this essay, I will attempt to analyse the merits of these theories when used in understanding the international political system. </s><s n="s3.3;p1.12">As well as this, I will advocate my own judgment on the effectiveness of the theories and come to a conclusion as to which is most successful in justifying the contemporary world order. </s></p><p n="p2.12"><s n="s1.6;p2.12">As mentioned previously, the dominant theory of International Relations is Realism. </s><s n="s2.6;p2.12">Perhaps this is due to its ability to justify the constant state of war that the world seems to be in. </s><s n="s3.6;p2.12">For realists, the sovereign state is the dominant actor in the anarchical world system. </s><s n="s4.6;p2.12">The theory suggests that individual states organise their actions, face the world as a unitary actor and proceed rationally to pursue state interests of power and security. </s><s n="s5.6;p2.12">Realists imply that the absence of a sovereign body from the international realm is cause for bargaining, alliances and the inevitable use of military force between states that seek to maintain security and to accumulate power. </s><s n="s6.6;p2.12">The recent behaviour of The United States in Iraq illustrates the length a state will go to in order to maintain state security. </s></p><p n="p3.12"><s n="s1.5;p3.12">The states' reliance on force and the threat of force results in an international struggle for power; there are two dominant theories that attempt to explain the workings of the world power-structure. </s><s n="s2.5;p3.12">Firstly, the Balance of Power Theory suggests that any action by a state will result in a counterbalancing action by the state that is being acted upon. </s><s n="s3.5;p3.12">This maintains long term peace as, so long as alliances are fluid, states will often ally against an anomalous state that has taken intolerable international actions. </s><s n="s4.5;p3.12">The theory also implies that a single state may act as a 'balancer', shifting its support to oppose whichever state is most threatening. </s><s n="s5.5;p3.12">The second, Hegemonic Stability Theory, takes this assumption further in suggesting that a single hegemonic state maintains international order through having the capability, will and commitment to enforce and uphold rules. </s></p><p n="p4.12"><s n="s1.3;p4.12">The paradigm is said to have been "a healthy dose of realism into the discussion of international relations following the delusions of idealism".<ref target="BAWE_0269d-ftnote.001"/> Whereas other paradigms, in particular Liberalism, are said to look at the world as it <hi rend="italic"> should be</hi>, realists pride themselves for looking at the world as it <hi rend="italic">is</hi>; a world portrayed as inherently adverse, anarchical and conflicting. </s><s n="s2.3;p4.12">However, there are still flaws in the theory; primarily the lack of attention paid to the influence of economic processes and non-state actors. </s><s n="s3.3;p4.12">Also, the proclamation that humans are naturally selfish may be an improbable misjudgement, as could the assumption that the domestic power structure of states is irrelevant when concerning international organisation. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0269d-ftnote.001"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.4;pn1.1">Hay, C. </s><s n="s2.4;pn1.1">(2002). </s><s n="s3.4;pn1.1"><hi rend="italic">Political Analysis</hi>. </s><s n="s4.4;pn1.1">New York: Palgrave, p.18. </s></p></note><p n="p5.12"><s n="s1.5;p5.12">Liberalism assumes that human nature, far from being self-seeking, is generally good and allows coexistence in liberty. </s><s n="s2.5;p5.12">The theory also promotes the benefit of social improvement and claims that humans have not yet reached political perfection but that democracy is the system by which it can be achieved. </s><s n="s3.5;p5.12">In contrast with Realists, the liberal ideology assumes that states, though important, are not the soul actors on the international field. </s><s n="s4.5;p5.12">A pluralistic approach is taken, where a dense network of trans-national transactions occurs and there is a strong link between a country's domestic and international sphere. </s><s n="s5.5;p5.12">This means that domestic conflicts of opinion may affect international organisation and the country by no means faces the international arena as a single, unitary state actor. </s></p><p n="p6.12"><s n="s1.4;p6.12">Where Liberalism, in my opinion, exceeds Realism is in its consideration of economics when analysing the international realm. </s><s n="s2.4;p6.12">Though Liberalists suggest a laissez-faire approach to economics in respect of government intervention, they still appreciate the importance of economic variables and advocate David Ricardo's<ref target="BAWE_0269d-ftnote.002"/> theory of comparative advantage in order to benefit from international division of labour. </s><s n="s3.4;p6.12">Key advancers in liberal thought such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek suggested that free trade, deregulation, privatisation and liberalisation were vital in order to allow Liberalism to be adopted and thrive on an international level. </s><s n="s4.4;p6.12">Therefore, the link between the political and economic aspects of the world system is not only unavoidable in Liberalist thinking but essential in order to promote its self perpetuating ideals. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0269d-ftnote.002"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.4;pn1.1">Ricardo, D.
