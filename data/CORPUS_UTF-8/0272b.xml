activities such as boycotting certain products, or buying fair trade goods. </s><s n="s5.7;p1.6">This reflects the changing nature of democracy, not just in Britain, but in the world as a whole. </s><s n="s6.7;p1.6">With increasing consensus in 'Westminster' politics, and Britain as a whole, on traditional economic and welfare issues, there has been a shift towards participation on behalf of 'post-materialist' issues, which has shaped this change in the way we participate, and the focus of participation. </s><s n="s7.7;p1.6">Democratic participation is no longer being exclusively exercised at the polls to influence Westminster; people are using their wallets and social conscience to lobby for change at a local, national and global level. </s></p><p n="p2.6"><s n="s1.12;p2.6">These changes in democratic participation have many possible explanations. </s><s n="s2.12;p2.6">The historic low turnouts of 2001 and 2005, at 59.3% and 61.3%<ref target="BAWE_0272b-ftnote.001"/> respectively seem to indicate that 40% of people simply do not care enough about politics or democracy to participate. </s><s n="s3.12;p2.6">This seems to be supported by another traditional indicator of participation, party membership. </s><s n="s4.12;p2.6">In the 1950s, 1 in 10 people were members of a political party; that has now dropped to 1 in 50<ref target="BAWE_0272b-ftnote.002"/>. </s><s n="s5.12;p2.6">However, this trend does not necessarily indicate a decline in participation, merely a change in the methods used. </s><s n="s6.12;p2.6">A Citizens Audit in 2000-2001, indicated that, in the past 12 months, 75% of those interviewed<ref target="BAWE_0272b-ftnote.003"/> had engaged in at least one activity intending to influence decision making. </s><s n="s7.12;p2.6">The majority of these activities were undertaken at an individual level, such as donating money, or signing petitions. </s><s n="s8.12;p2.6">This change is indicative of a wider change in lifestyle, and what Robert Putnam would describe as 'social capital'<ref target="BAWE_0272b-ftnote.004"/>. </s><s n="s9.12;p2.6">The behavioural changes brought about by the rise of television, internet, e-mail and online shopping have permeated political participation too. </s><s n="s10.12;p2.6">It is no longer necessary to join a political party to support them; you can now pay a donation by direct debit over the internet, or sign an internet petition to show your support for a particular issue. </s><s n="s11.12;p2.6">This has been expanded in recent years, particularly through the internet, with 'weblogs' and political websites gaining increasing prominence in election campaigns as a way of participating. </s><s n="s12.12;p2.6">The decline in voting and party membership has shown a fall in traditional participation, but this is equal to a rise in new, individual forms of participation arguably brought about by a changing, more inter-connected and globalised world. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0272b-ftnote.001"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.2;pn1.1">Electoral Commission Report, "Election 2005: Turnout", 19th October 2005. </s><s n="s2.2;pn1.1">Available from <seg type="URL" n="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/templates/search/document.cfm/13874"/> Accessed 9th February 2006 </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0272b-ftnote.002"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.2;pn1.1">Whitely, P. </s><s n="s2.2;pn1.1">"Civic Renewal and Participation in Britain" Available from <seg type="URL" n="www.active-citizen.org.uk/files/downloads/Reports/"/> p.15/16 </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0272b-ftnote.003"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.2;pn1.1">Whitely, P. </s><s n="s2.2;pn1.1">"Civic Renewal and Participation in Britain" Available from <seg type="URL" n="www.active-citizen.org.uk/files/downloads/Reports/"/> p.7 </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0272b-ftnote.004"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Putnam, Robert, (2001) "Bowling Alone: the collapse and revival of American community" New York: Touchstone </s></p></note><p n="p3.6"><s n="s1.8;p3.6">Globalisation in its more radical sense may also explain the changing nature and focus of democratic participation in Britain. </s><s n="s2.8;p3.6">The creation of a neo-liberal, market orientated world has taken a great deal of decision making power away from national government, as has further integration into the E.U.
