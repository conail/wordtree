target="BAWE_0275a-ftnote.004"/> This is reflected in the design of the website: The layout has a more light-hearted, less forceful tone, achieved by the yellow background and a 'happy' picture of a

clearly labelled sections. </s><s n="s2.6;p6.32">Two of these have been made redundant since the closure of the organisation: listings of events are no longer available, and new members are not being accepted. </s><s n="s3.6;p6.32">However, application for membership was once an available option, and the sign up process appears to be fairly straightforward. </s><s n="s4.6;p6.32">But as the website is not very inviting, a person would have to be quite committed to the causes of the organisation to consider becoming a member. </s><s n="s5.6;p6.32">There was also the possibility of making an online donation to either the British faction or the American one; or of purchasing merchandise online. </s><s n="s6.6;p6.32">This not only contributes to the finances of the group, but also to the spread of publicity and support. </s></p><p n="p7.32"><s n="s1.6;p7.32">There are few images on the website and these are only small thumbnails which cannot be expanded to a reasonable size. </s><s n="s2.6;p7.32">The limited number of photos can only be found by clicking on the 'F4J in action' link or the section about Pierce Brosnan. </s><s n="s3.6;p7.32">This makes the website stark in comparison to those of other pressure groups. </s><s n="s4.6;p7.32">For example, when accessing the 'Greenpeace' web page, one is greeted with an outburst of colour and vivid images, making the website eye-catching. </s><s n="s5.6;p7.32">Fathers 4 Justice could perhaps benefit from this example, and make their website more appealing. </s><s n="s6.6;p7.32">Dressing up as superheroes or as Father Christmas' has provided the media with great visual tools and it is a shame that Fathers 4 Justice does not harness this to enhance the webpage. </s></p><p n="p8.32"><s n="s1.1;p8.32">There is also a lack of other resources such as radio extracts or videos, which could also be a useful tool for attracting and maintaining people's attention. </s></p><p n="p9.32"><s n="s1.3;p9.32">It is plausible, nevertheless unlikely, that the simplicity of the website may be intentional: By keeping the information short and easy to access Fathers 4 Justice are more likely to get the desired message across, and people can get an overall impression of the organisation by having a quick glance through the website. </s><s n="s2.3;p9.32">Having a cluttered website with an excess of information can be overwhelming and discouraging for the reader. </s><s n="s3.3;p9.32">Also, the website downloads almost instantaneously which is a positive feature. </s></p><p n="p10.32"><s n="s1.2;p10.32">However the website has a comprehensive press section which is to be commended, as it provides the reader with an expansive source of information about the organisation, and the way in which it is run. </s><s n="s2.2;p10.32">It also helps legitimise the organisation's claims and standing by providing thoughts other than those engineered by Fathers 4 Justice, trying to create a good image. </s></p><p n="p11.32"><s n="s1.4;p11.32">The website provides an introduction to the formation of the organisation and its aims and objectives. </s><s n="s2.4;p11.32">Using short and bold facts, and an explanation of its 'legacy', Fathers 4 Justice has tried to add credibility to its name, and gain the reader's support. </s><s n="s3.4;p11.32">This is demonstrated by the 'Pledge' signed by Matthew O'Conner, attempting to incite compassion and give the website a personal feel.<ref target="BAWE_0275a-ftnote.005"/> Fathers 4 Justice has also tried to encourage people to take an interest in the campaign by highlighting the support Pierce Brosnan and Bob Geldorf have for the organisation. </s><s n="s4.4;p11.32">The website has various emboldened quotes by Bob Geldorf such as: "I cannot believe what is done to parents in the name of the law"<ref target="BAWE_0275a-ftnote.006"/>, trying to validate its cause. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0275a-ftnote.005"><p n="pn1.1"><s

more information regarding what Fathers 4 Justice has achieved, and its different campaigns, and also by expanding on how the organisation has spread to other countries. </s><s n="s3.4;p12.32">This
