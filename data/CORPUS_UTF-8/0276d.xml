increased level of off-shore dredging by commercial companies. </s><s n="s2.3;p1.13">They feel this has an adverse effect on their communities who rely heavily on tourism, fishing, surfing and the natural habitat of the Welsh Gower and so have started a pressure group which campaigns on several levels to try and inform the Welsh Government of the issue and ultimately achieve a change in government policy to restrict the dredging. </s><s n="s3.3;p1.13">The group campaigns on a largely local level but is very much led, or guided, by its internet site which aims to increase awareness and concern of the issue and provide potential supporters with ideas of to support this cause. </s></p><p n="p2.13"><s n="s1.14;p2.13">To achieve their aims the pressure group obviously need an accessible, clear and focused web site which provokes interest, assures the credibility of its cause and sufficiently motivates others to be involved. </s><s n="s2.14;p2.13">The site<ref target="BAWE_0276d-ftnote.001"/> presents itself well with relevant photographs and clear graphics which enhance interest and make the website easy to navigate. </s><s n="s3.14;p2.13">The design enables one to quickly discover what the pressure group are opposed to and why they feel so strongly. </s><s n="s4.14;p2.13">The informative tone of the website explains the history of off-shore dredging and provides scientific evidence to substantiate its concerns. </s><s n="s5.14;p2.13">In addition it provides references for scientific data and links to other websites for more information on the problem. </s><s n="s6.14;p2.13">This enables potential supporters to look into the problem in more depth without boring or alienating those not interested in scientific research. </s><s n="s7.14;p2.13">Other links include websites from fishing websites, surfers, and a BBC news article which all illustrate that the Welsh Gower is widely used and treasured by much of society and especially vital for Welsh tourism if not for its habitat and beauty as an AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty). </s><s n="s8.14;p2.13">The website enthusiastically encourages people to become involved in a number of ways from organising petitions or writing to their MP's to attending protests or subscribing to their email news. </s><s n="s9.14;p2.13">Central to any involvement in the group is the website and the email newsletters. </s><s n="s10.14;p2.13">Any protests, publicity campaigns, petitions or any organised protest by Gower SOS is directly coordinated and correlated by its website. </s><s n="s11.14;p2.13">This means that anyone with access to the World Wide Web is able to participate in the activities of the group and enables a localised issue to become more widespread. </s><s n="s12.14;p2.13">So too the website informs a potential supporter of when government decisions on the issue will be made and of current developments. </s><s n="s13.14;p2.13">It informs one that the issue of off-shore dredging has been recognised by the Welsh government who have noted their concern and will shortly issue a decision on the licensing of the dredging companies. </s><s n="s14.14;p2.13">In this way the website appears to cover many of the concerns of the pressure group and the battle they face against government policy which seems to favour commercial interests. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0276d-ftnote.001"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.2;pn1.1"><seg type="URL" n="www.gowersos.com"/>. </s><s n="s2.2;pn1.1">Accessed 16/04/04 </s></p></note><p n="p3.13"><s n="s1.9;p3.13">When reading the website it became increasingly obvious how localised interest in the pressure group really is. </s><s n="s2.9;p3.13">The majority of people who feel passionately about the issue are more likely to be those who use, or rely on the Gower. </s><s n="s3.9;p3.13">As such the majority of campaigning will be done on a local level and therefore I began to question how useful a website is for the pressure group. </s><s n="s4.9;p3.13">Does an internet site really make the pressure group any more effective? </s><s n="s5.9;p3.13">However when reading the Marine Aggregate Dredging policy by the Welsh Assembly about the issue I realised that the pressure group serves not only to inform supporters but also to legitimise itself to others, namely government. </s><s n="s6.9;p3.13">Any MP disregarding the interest in protecting the Welsh Gower could be referred to the website as a prime example of organised, systematic and valid concern as to the future of the Gower. </s><s n="s7.9;p3.13">So too the pressure group is accessible to all enabling people who are interested in the cause but may not be able to participate actively to participate by sending emails to their MP's and having their views and support recognised. </s><s n="s8.9;p3.13">Thus for this pressure group, despite its localised problem the internet site remains crucial to the work and objectives of Gower SOS. The website is useful because it identifies the views of many Welsh communities and not only represents these views but gains support for the campaign from other communities who would maybe not otherwise hear of such a campaign. </s><s n="s9.9;p3.13">Not only this the website acts as a tool to promote future protest campaigns and to legitimise their campaign. </s></p><p n="p4.13"><s n="s1.14;p4.13">Recognising the need for the pressure group to have a website however does not indicate the effectiveness of the website in helping the pressure group to achieve it aims. </s><s n="s2.14;p4.13">For some idea of how the website serves its purpose I looked at another pressure group with similar localised aims and a website central to its work. </s><s n="s3.14;p4.13">Save our Green Fields<ref target="BAWE_0276d-ftnote.002"/> campaigns against proposed commercial housing developments in a similarly small Welsh community. </s><s n="s4.14;p4.13">It is a pressure group initiated by the community and getting involved can take various forms including email petitions as well as active volunteering. </s><s n="s5.14;p4.13">What struck me about Save our Green Fields was its simple and accessible explanation of its aims and processes which were harder to access and complicated to understand on Gower SOS. Despite its simple presentation format the website holds so much information, much of it scientific, it can be hard to read through and interpret. </s><s n="s6.14;p4.13">So too it is hard to know when things have been posted onto the website and when it was last updated. </s><s n="s7.14;p4.13">Many old articles remain making it difficult to know where the pressure group now stands. </s><s n="s8.14;p4.13">Save our Green Fields had designated links to describe its aims alongside a clear explanation of its argument with bold, highlighted parts of text. </s><s n="s9.14;p4.13">In contrast Gower SOS had less clear information on any clear goals they hoped to achieve and concentrated more on reacting defensively to the proposed policies threatening their communities than asserting any positive plan. </s><s n="s10.14;p4.13">Whereas Save our Green Fields offered an email and postal address, phone and fax number Gower SOS neglected to do so which leaves any potential supporter with questions with nowhere to address their queries and implies Gower SOS are non-accountable as a pressure group. </s><s n="s11.14;p4.13">This raises questions as to whether they are representational of public opinion as they fail to allow any potential questions from would-be supporters. </s><s n="s12.14;p4.13">There are also some minor spelling errors on the website which would possibly dissuade people of the validity and legitimacy of the pressure group. </s><s n="s13.14;p4.13">My suggestions for the website would be that there are dates of when articles have been uploaded and frequent updates as to the progress of the pressure group. </s><s n="s14.14;p4.13">I also feel it could benefit from communicating clear strategies for how the pressure group wish to proceed in their aims. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0276d-ftnote.002"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.2;pn1.1"><seg type="URL" n="www.sogf.freeserve.co.uk/"/>. </s><s n="s2.2;pn1.1">Accessed 24/04/03 </s></p></note><p n="p5.13"><s n="s1.9;p5.13">In order to assess the effectiveness of Gower SOS we also need to differentiate between what we mean by effectiveness, what sort of effect pressure groups are able to wield and how. </s><s n="s2.9;p5.13">Pressure groups, as suggested by Grant, do not have power over any other agent (namely government) and change their actions (or policies in this case) to conform to their own demands. </s><s n="s3.9;p5.13">Instead pressure groups are able to exert influence over their neighbours: enticing, encouraging, persuading and sometimes threatening them to alter their behaviour. </s><s n="s4.9;p5.13">So here we can ascertain the way in which pressure groups can be effective. </s><s n="s5.9;p5.13">However are we therefore presuming that, for pressure groups, effectiveness can be judged only so as to their success is changing policies of government or of other agents? </s><s n="s6.9;p5.13">Derthick states that effectiveness can be measured in ratio to the achievement of goals so for pressure groups achieving their aims would quite simply imply effectiveness<ref target="BAWE_0276d-ftnote.003"/>. </s><s n="s7.9;p5.13">However this model is simplistic in that one cannot assume that policy success can be attributed to any one pressure group only (or even at all). </s><s n="s8.9;p5.13">Perhaps when Grant wrote of the influence of pressure groups in 'Pressure Groups and British Policies' he was correct in his interpretation that effective pressure groups can make an effect being influential without succeeding in changing policies<ref target="BAWE_0276d-ftnote.004"/>. </s><s n="s9.9;p5.13">With these differing conceptions of what makes a pressure group effective let us examine Gower SOS. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0276d-ftnote.003"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.3;pn1.1">Wooton, G. </s><s n="s2.3;pn1.1">(1970) <hi rend="underlined">Interest Groups.</hi> </s><s n="s3.3;pn1.1">New Jersey: Prentice Hall. p.74 </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0276d-ftnote.004"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.4;pn1.1">Grant, W. </s><s n="s2.4;pn1.1">(2000). </s><s rend="underlined" n="s3.4;pn1.1">Pressure Groups and British Politics. </s><s n="s4.4;pn1.1">Basingstoke:Macmillan. p.193-212 </s></p></note><p n="p6.13"><s n="s1.5;p6.13">The impact of Gower SOS is somewhat indefinable due to the nature of its cause. </s><s n="s2.5;p6.13">Increasingly Governments, the Welsh Assembly in particular, are taking note of environmental issues partly due to existence of growing global environmental groups such as Greenpeace and therefore any progress cannot be necessarily attributed to Gower SOS.
