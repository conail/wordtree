or if there is any point for them to be included, other than as artistic devices. </s><s n="s4.11;p1.9">On the one hand, Marquez may use them to allude to certain types of characters such as the strong, outgoing Jose Arcadios or the solitary and studious Aurelianos. </s><s n="s5.11;p1.9">On the other hand, he may use the magical elements in his novel to accentuate a certain theme he is exploring. </s><s n="s6.11;p1.9">There are many events in the novel that cause debates over whether magic is present or not. </s><s n="s7.11;p1.9">The reason for confusions such as this is that Marquez plays with the reader's expectations of time, reality and history. </s><s n="s8.11;p1.9">Interestingly one can claim that this may be seen as an example of magic; as Marquez has utilized the basic style of modernist literature and cultivated it to the extent that he even places himself in the novel as an active character. </s><s n="s9.11;p1.9">His novel has since been placed in the magical realism category and this itself is a 'narrative style which consistently blurs the traditional realist distinction between fantasy and reality." </s><ref target="BAWE_0280f-ftnote.001"/><s n="s10.11;p1.9">Marquez clearly uses magic to mark a point at certain times in the novel. </s><s n="s11.11;p1.9">By simply being completely extraordinary in nature, the magic he uses marks events he describes even more vividly than the simple narrative of more traditional novel. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0280f-ftnote.001"><p n="pn1.2"><s n="s1.1;pn1.2">Bernard Mcguirk and Richard Cardwell, Gabriel Garcia Marques (Cambridge University Press 1987) </s></p><p n="pn2.2"><s n="s1.2;pn2.2">p. </s><s n="s2.2;pn2.2">45. </s></p></note><p n="p2.9"><s n="s1.16;p2.9">One of the most vivid, shocking and important magical images in the novel is that of the 'pig's tail.' </s><s n="s2.16;p2.9">It is mentioned early on in the novel by Ursula, the wife of the founder of the town, Jose Arcadio Buendia. </s><s n="s3.16;p2.9">This image of a Buendia child being born with a pig's tail seems to haunt Ursula all the way through the novel, despite the fact that it is only mentioned about four or five times. </s><s n="s4.16;p2.9">It appears early in the novel when Ursula expresses her worries about having a child with a pig's tail when she marries her cousin Jose Arcadio Buendia (Macondo's founder.) </s><s n="s5.16;p2.9">She is worried about this because when her aunt married to an uncle of Jose Arcadio Buendia's they had a son who was born with the tail of a pig: 'for he had been born and had grown up with a cartilaginous tail in the shape of s corkscrew and with a small tuft of hair on the tip." </s><ref target="BAWE_0280f-ftnote.002"/><s n="s6.16;p2.9">This image is particularly exceptional as it refers directly to another of the book's main themes; the theme of incest. </s><s n="s7.16;p2.9">Marquez makes this image particularly repulsive by the comparison of the tail to a corkscrew and the inclusion of hair on it. </s><s n="s8.16;p2.9">This clearly shows that incest is a taboo as it is in reality. </s><s n="s9.16;p2.9">In many societies, there still exists myths that claim that a child from sex between family members can cause physical defects in that child. </s><s n="s10.16;p2.9">An example is said to be that the child may be born with six toes or fingers. </s><s n="s11.16;p2.9">Marquez takes this one step further, making this claim seem rather ridiculous. </s><s n="s12.16;p2.9">However, this image appears again later in the novel when Ursula is 'convinced that the wild behavior of her children was something as fearful as a pig's tail." </s><ref target="BAWE_0280f-ftnote.003"/><s n="s13.16;p2.9">Clearly Ursula does believe in the misfortunes of having a child through incest. </s><s n="s14.16;p2.9">This magical image, very alike to the punishment of a naughty child in a fairytale is used by Marquez possibly to show how ingrained the myth of incest is in the minds of the population of Latin America and even the rest of the world. </s><s n="s15.16;p2.9">It may also be used to punish the characters for their defiance of social traditions as the very last Buendia to be born through sex between brother and sister, Aureliano and Amarata Ursula, is also the one to be born with the tail of a pig. </s><s n="s16.16;p2.9">Due to its proximity to the end of the novel, this image suggests that the Buendia line is doomed and that it always has been. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0280f-ftnote.002"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.2;pn1.1">Gabriel Garcia Marques, 100 Years of Solitude.
