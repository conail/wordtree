namely, direct self-reference. </s><s n="s11.14;p5.8">However, banning self-reference would have dire consequences on the rest of the natural languages. </s><s n="s12.14;p5.8">Non-paradoxical sentences such as 'This sentence is printed' make perfect sense. </s><s n="s13.14;p5.8">Also, Gödel's proof of the incompleteness of arithmetic relies on the foundation provided by self-referential sentences. </s><s n="s14.14;p5.8">Additionally, designating sentences that possess non-referring grammatical subjects as meaningless would render such innocuous statements such as 'every unicorn has a horn' to be without meaning, despite being understandable to anyone who possesses the relevant ideas, although the subject matter may not exist. </s></p><p n="p6.8"><s n="s1.15;p6.8">Alfred Tarski, a polish logician, proposed in a 1933 paper a method by which true sentences could be defined that avoided the use of other semantic terms. </s><s n="s2.15;p6.8">His formal conception of a true statement was one that satisfied the criteria of material adequacy: X is true if and only if p where `X' is replaced by the structural-descriptive name (or quotation name) of a sentence and `p' is replaced by the sentence. </s><s n="s3.15;p6.8">However, under this treatment, named Convention T, a paradox could be obtained upon substitution of a sentence of the form 'U is not true'. </s><s n="s4.15;p6.8">The Liar and Quine's paradox are both eligible candidates for this situation (under Convention T a legitimate declarative sentence is either true or else false<ref target="BAWE_0285c-ftnote.001"/>, so there is no need for the strengthened Liar; not true = false). </s><s n="s5.15;p6.8">This is because both expressions make use of natural language's ability to talk about its own semantics. </s><s n="s6.15;p6.8">In order to prevent both paradoxes from operating, Tarski set forth his theory of the hierarchy of languages. </s><s n="s7.15;p6.8">Under this proposal, the truth of an object language, O, can only be defined by the metalanguage, M. Thus, the liar can only come about in the innocuous form 'This sentence is false-in-O', which must itself be a sentence of M, and hence cannot be true-in-O, and is false instead of paradoxical. </s><s n="s8.15;p6.8">This renders the Liar sentence unable to produce a contradiction because its truth or falsity is beyond its ability to state. </s><s n="s9.15;p6.8">For Tarski, truth cannot be defined for semantically closed languages, where the global truth predicate "is a true sentence" can be characterised. </s><s n="s10.15;p6.8">Instead, truth in a particular language must appeal to another language a step higher in the hierarchy. </s><s n="s11.15;p6.8">This is Tarski's 'Undefinability Theorem'. </s><s n="s12.15;p6.8">Under this treatment, both the Liar and Quine's paradox are powerless to achieve their desired perplexing ends. </s><s n="s13.15;p6.8">However, by forcing Tarski to make this claim, the paradoxes have cornered language into artificiality. </s><s n="s14.15;p6.8">As Haack has mentioned, Tarski's theorem seems to lack intuitive justification independent of its utility to combat paradoxes in natural language<ref target="BAWE_0285c-ftnote.002"/>. </s><s n="s15.15;p6.8">The Undefinability Theorem is an ad hoc response in this regard, and offers no further aid in defining what exactly constitutes truth. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0285c-ftnote.001"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1"><seg type="URL" n="http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/par-liar.htm"/>: section 2- possible solutions </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0285c-ftnote.002"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">S.
