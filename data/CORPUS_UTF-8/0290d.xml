Compare and contrast IKEA's operations performance objectives with those of 'traditional' competitors. How is this influenced by the company's overall competitive strategy? </head><p n="p1.24"><s n="s1.6;p1.24">Ikea's strategy is to provide furnishings at low prices that represent value for money with a wide range of choice. </s><s n="s2.6;p1.24">This is achieved through flat packed furniture which the customer assembles themselves. </s><s n="s3.6;p1.24">'Traditional' competitors provide high quality bespoke furnishings, which are ready assembled and delivered when ready. </s><s n="s4.6;p1.24">Performance objectives highlight the reasons that consumers purchase goods or services from an organisation in preference to a competitor. </s><s n="s5.6;p1.24">Slack et al (2003), define 5 difference performance objectives, these are quality, speed, flexibility, dependability and cost. </s><s n="s6.6;p1.24">I will evaluate each of these performance objectives for IKEA against the traditional competitor. </s></p><p n="p2.24"><s n="s1.5;p2.24">Ikea's flat packed furniture is made to a high quality standard, although it needs to be transported and assembled by the customer. </s><s n="s2.5;p2.24">The quality is dependent of the customer's ability to assembly the furniture. </s><s n="s3.5;p2.24">'Traditional' competitors have the product assembled in a warehouse and is professionally delivered to the customers home. </s><s n="s4.5;p2.24">The quality should be better in this instance, although this isn't always the case. </s><s n="s5.5;p2.24">Ikea would rate quality as important, although probably not as much as the traditional competitor. </s></p><p n="p3.24"><s n="s1.6;p3.24">Flat packed furniture takes up less storage space so IKEA can hold more units in the store warehouse and the regional depots. </s><s n="s2.6;p3.24">This allows the customer to take the furniture home on the date of purchase. </s><s n="s3.6;p3.24">Traditional competitors usually have a show room, where the customer can select their products, however, these need to be ordered, assembled and delivered to the customers home, which can take up to 12 weeks. </s><s n="s4.6;p3.24">An exception of this is when traditional competitors sell the display items. </s><s n="s5.6;p3.24">These are normally sold as seen and can be taken away when purchased. </s><s n="s6.6;p3.24">Therefore IKEA would rate speed as important, whilst the traditional competitor would not. </s></p><p n="p4.24"><s n="s1.7;p4.24">Ikea's sales strategy requires that products need to be available in the store when a customer attempts to make a purchase. </s><s n="s2.7;p4.24">If the stock is not in the store, then the customer will leave empty handed, unless they order an item. </s><s n="s3.7;p4.24">This may not be feasible if customers drive a substantial distance to shop at Ikea, which in turn would deter these customers returning. </s><s n="s4.7;p4.24">Traditional competitors can accept customer orders and flex their supply in accordance with these orders. </s><s n="s5.7;p4.24">Vague and distant delivery dates allow them to cope with any demand for the products. </s><s n="s6.7;p4.24">Delivery dates and times are agreed with the customer when the product is available, and although the range of delivery time is usually long, the customer can arrange delivery around their needs. </s><s n="s7.7;p4.24">Therefore Ikea would need to be dependable to be profitable, whilst traditional competitors build in time buffers to allow themselves to achieve this. </s></p><p n="p5.24"><s n="s1.5;p5.24">Ikea provides a wide range of choice within its stores. </s><s n="s2.5;p5.24">This is not only limited to furnishings, but also the colours of the furnishings and the fixtures that can be sold along side the furniture. </s><s n="s3.5;p5.24">Ikea has to be flexible to provide this. </s><s n="s4.5;p5.24">Therefore Ikea would not rate flexibility as being important as a performance objective. </s><s n="s5.5;p5.24">Traditional competitors offer a lot more flexibility in terms of the product selection, such as fabric and colour. </s></p><p n="p6.24"><s n="s1.4;p6.24">Ikea's whole strategy is to allow customers to have quality goods at a low price, and therefore must compete against the traditional competitor, which is usually expensive. </s><s n="s2.4;p6.24">There is a potential trade off between the quality and the cost of producing an item, so IKEA works closely with it's suppliers to help them to provide products at low prices, without compromising on quality. </s><s n="s3.4;p6.24">They even go as far as using multiple suppliers to provide different elements for a product. </s><s n="s4.4;p6.24">Ikea would rate cost as very important, whereas the competitor would not. </s></p><p n="p7.24"><s n="s1.1;p7.24">All of these performance objectives can be displayed in a polar diagram, which represents the relative importance of the performance objectives for a product or service. </s></p><p n="p8.24"><s n="s1.1;p8.24"><formula notation="" id="BAWE_0290d-form.001"/> </s></p><p n="p9.24"><s n="s1.8;p9.24">Ikea's competitive strategy is to provide furnishings at low prices that represent value for money. </s><s n="s2.8;p9.24">These strategic decisions often contradict with each other. </s><s n="s3.8;p9.24">Low cost operators often struggle to maintain quality in their bid to reduce costs. </s><s n="s4.8;p9.24">Whilst Ikea is seen to be at the lower end of the furniture markets, it takes the middle ground here by attempting to achieve both. </s><s n="s5.8;p9.24">Ikea's global position and low price strategy puts it in line with other global retailers such as Wal-Mart. </s><s n="s6.8;p9.24">Wal-Mart's strategy focuses very much on the bottom line, so that savings can be passed on to the customer. </s><s n="s7.8;p9.24">However, this is now seen to be at the expense of employees and suppliers, which is giving Wal-Mart bad press. </s><s n="s8.8;p9.24">In contrast to this, IKEA provides products at a low cost, but attempts to work with the supplier to provide them with low prices without compromising quality and socio-economic standards. </s></p><p n="p10.24"><s n="s1.5;p10.24">Processing costs of providing products can be reduced by providing a low variety of products in high quantities, with a low variation in demand through a sales environment offering low customer contact. </s><s n="s2.5;p10.24">Ikea fits this model very well offering high volume products, through low visibility operations throughout the year. </s><s n="s3.5;p10.24">Traditional competitors provide a different service. </s><s n="s4.5;p10.24">They offer a more visible service, with a better range of products with greater quality. </s><s n="s5.5;p10.24">However, these products are very slow to be delivered. </s></p><p n="p11.24"><s n="s1.4;p11.24">In conclusion, Ikea's competitive strategy of supplying furnishing at low prices that represent good value for money is achieved, not by providing the lowest prices, but offering the best combination of the two. </s><s n="s2.4;p11.24">Examples exist where companies have striven for only one of these factors, which can be profitable, but can also cause problems. </s><s n="s3.4;p11.24">Ikea aims to be profitable in this way by supplying products in great volume with a large range of variety. </s><s n="s4.4;p11.24">It keeps costs down by providing a low variation of consumer demand delivered with a low visibility operation. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Question 2.

it also notes that the UK stores get replenished via a distribution centre in Sweden, which would take time to deliver to the UK stores, as well as the cost in transporting the items. </s><s n="s6.7;p16.24">A DC in the UK would be essential if Ikea were to increase the number of stores. </s><s n="s7.7;p16.24">This would be essential if Ikea increases the number of stores by taking on smaller stores with less warehouse capacity. </s></p><p n="p17.24"><s n="s1.6;p17.24">Ikea, like many large retailers in the UK, are finding it difficult to get the necessary planning permission to build the large stores it requires. </s><s n="s2.6;p17.24">Ikea attempts to locate its stores close to dense urban areas, with convenient access to major road networks. </s><s n="s3.6;p17.24">Currently there are only fourteen stores in the UK, which welcome on average 10,000 people per day (Smyth 2004); 30% of which drive more than 2 hours to reach the store (BBC 2006). </s><s n="s4.6;p17.24">Ikea has ambitions to extend the number of stores, having recently announced that it is to open a city centre store in Coventry in 2007. </s><s n="s5.6;p17.24">It has also announced plans to develop a website that allows customers in certain area to purchase item on the internet (BBC 2006). </s><s n="s6.6;p17.24">In November, Ikea Germany announced plans to increase its mail-order business by launching its own home shopping shows. </s></p><p n="p18.24"><s n="s1.6;p18.24">Ikea splits its stock into 3 categories; Catalogue items, not catalogued and discontinued (from assignment text). </s><s n="s2.6;p18.24">This is similar to many other retailers, my own employer in the clothing business categorises lines into seasonality (autumn/winter and spring/summer), continuity and old. </s><s n="s3.6;p18.24">Within continuity, there is a further subset of items, which are the key selling lines. </s><s n="s4.6;p18.24">Availability of these key lines is constantly monitored. </s><s n="s5.6;p18.24">This helps prioritise warehouse shipments. </s><s n="s6.6;p18.24">I would assume that Ikea also closely monitors its catalogue items, because customers expect these items to be in the store, and no availability will reflect negatively on Ikea. </s></p><p n="p19.24"><s n="s1.10;p19.24">Many of Ikeas operations decisions are based around improving the environment and the lives of suppliers who work for them. </s><s n="s2.10;p19.24">Freight companies working for Ikea are required to provide statistics for their Environmental performance sheet (Ikea 2003 a). </s><s n="s3.10;p19.24">Ikea has also pledged to double the amount of freight to be transported by rail to 40% over the next 3 years (Ikea 2003 a). </s><s n="s4.10;p19.24">Ikea already works with their suppliers in order to help them achieve low prices without compromising the quality or their relationships with suppliers. </s><s n="s5.10;p19.24">(Ikea 2003 b). </s><s n="s6.10;p19.24">Many larger retailers look at the way Ikea works with their suppliers and their commitment to the environment and have taken action themselves. </s><s n="s7.10;p19.24">An example of this is Wal-Mart, whose CEO Lee Scott announced that what steps Wal-Mart would take in the light of hurricane Katrina. </s><s n="s8.10;p19.24">He announced, amongst other things, that Wal-Mart would strive to increase the efficiency of their trucks by 25% over 3 years and double it within 10 years. </s><s n="s9.10;p19.24">An increase of 1 mpg in every Wal-Mart truck would save the company $52m every year (Scott 2005). </s><s n="s10.10;p19.24">This demonstrates that small environmental efficiencies can make a large difference. </s></p><p n="p20.24"><s n="s1.4;p20.24">Taking all of this information into account, Ikea attempts to be pro-active in its operations decisions. </s><s n="s2.4;p20.24">It has started to respond to customer criticisms by increasing the number of stores, despite taking the difficult decision of taking on new format stores. </s><s n="s3.4;p20.24">This in turn will have an impact on its operations because it does not have the supply infrastructure to cope with the new formats. </s><s n="s4.4;p20.24">Ikea has fantastic relationships with its suppliers, who in turn, produce sustainable products for the best prices. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Question 3.
