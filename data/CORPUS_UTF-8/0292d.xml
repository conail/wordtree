habit of only criticising after the event" wrote Mao Tse-Tung<ref target="BAWE_0292d-ftnote.001"/> and it is important that the benefits of hindsight and the fact of Mao's absence do not cloud our judgements of his life and work. </s><s n="s2.13;p1.8">In power for 27 years, Mao's effect on China was undeniably far reaching and is undoubtedly still felt today. </s><s n="s3.13;p1.8">To an outsider, the fact that China is still ruled by the Chinese Communist Party may make it seem as though communism<ref target="BAWE_0292d-ftnote.002"/> in China is still going strong and that the principles of Mao are a continuing success. </s><s n="s4.13;p1.8">However, although as a figurehead Mao is still a very important part of the Chinese consciousness, a massive portrait and his tomb are still a central part of Beijing<ref target="BAWE_0292d-ftnote.003"/>, many changes have been made to the ideological legacy he left behind in 1976, with many commentators describing China today as only "nominally communist"<ref target="BAWE_0292d-ftnote.004"/>. </s><s n="s5.13;p1.8">Mao has been credited for creating a mostly unified China, free of foreign domination, for the first time since the Opium Wars, but his economic policies have been widely criticised. </s><s n="s6.13;p1.8">While these were ideologically motivated, their faliure is not necessarily a faliure of the ideology, but may be a just be poor practical realsiation. </s><s n="s7.13;p1.8">Other main areas of criticism are his contribution to the Sino-Soviet Split, his establishment of a one-party dictatorship, and initiating the disastrous Cultural Revolution, but these were all motivated by practical concerns of the time rather than directly from a communist ideology. </s><s n="s8.13;p1.8">Therefore, in order to evaluate Mao's legacy the focus must be on the economic policies, as these can be more closely linked to a communist ideology. </s><s n="s9.13;p1.8">The perceptions of the party leaders and the people are the key issue here, how they initially viewed the ideology and how they felt during Mao's period in office. </s><s n="s10.13;p1.8">It is also important to look at the changes that have taken place since Mao's death and their effect on perceptions of his success or faliure. </s><s n="s11.13;p1.8">Another difficulty is that in China, and in fact across the world, true communism has arguably never been established. </s><s n="s12.13;p1.8">Marx's stages of communism, requiring the overthow of the bourgeoise by the proletariat, the establishment of socialism and then the gradual move towards communal living are designed to be enacted over a considerable length of time and no major modern state has ever made it past socialism. </s><s n="s13.13;p1.8">However, if the people and party leaders are seen to move away not only from Mao's specific ideological way but from a communist one altogether, then it would appear they believe that path has failed them. </s></p><note

was the nationalist Kuomintang, not affiliated with the imperialists and actually adhering to socialist style principles, who were defeated in order to gain control, confuses matters somewhat. </s><s n="s6.10;p2.8">This confusion is exacerbated by the fact that the Communist party also advocated nationalist principles, promising to unite China after the strain of Civil War and to stamp out the corruption that was rife under imperial rule. </s><s n="s7.10;p2.8">While this did fit with Mao's ideologically pure ideals, many of the people who supported these aspects of the revolution were not totally committed to the other side, Mao's version of Marxist/Leninist communism. </s><s n="s8.10;p2.8">"The first years of the People's Republic were exciting. </s><s n="s9.10;p2.8">Corruption, that

they would behave unselfishly as defined by Marxist-Leninists. </s><s n="s3.9;p3.8">However, because the embracing of communism was not necessarily as deep as popular support for the revolution suggested a certain amount of coercion was required in order to promote Mao's egalitarian principles. </s><s n="s4.9;p3.8">On an ideological level, the majority are only concerned about their livelihoods, "philosophy is a luxury" and this means that the success or failure, in their eyes, of a particular system is determined by how it leaves them economically. </s><s n="s5.9;p3.8">In communist thinking, the proletariat take control of the means of production but in practice this means the party must run the economy. </s><s n="s6.9;p3.8">For all the communist states, bureaucracy and administration have been major difficulties but what many economists believe to be insurmountable is the economic calculation problem, which states that the use of price controls within an economy
