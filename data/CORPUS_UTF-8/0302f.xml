were ill- prepared to become the world's chief creditor after the war, however, so leant heavily and unwisely to borrowers in Europe, in particular Germany, who later had trouble repaying the loans.

Germany in particular, already indebted to the United States the recall of loans to US banks spread the depression, creating an international rather than just an American depression. </s><s n="s6.11;p2.11">Insular economic policies with high tariffs alongside foreign loans and attempts to export products, in particular by the Americans but later copied by European countries, put further pressures on the economy. </s><s n="s7.11;p2.11">In America this was exacerbated by the new spending trends, with consumers using credit and bank loans to pay for goods. </s><s n="s8.11;p2.11">Additionally, the First World War inadvertently prolonged the depression as it led to political mistrust. </s><s n="s9.11;p2.11">International action to halt the depression, therefore, was impossible to achieve. </s><s n="s10.11;p2.11">However, as Peter Fearon argues, the war "only exacerbated and accelerated economic problems." </s><ref target="BAWE_0302f-ftnote.004"/><s

is often perceived as the "Roaring Twenties." </s><s n="s3.8;p3.11">The social situation, however, was anything but that for many sections of American society, with over half of all Americans too poor to take part in the boom. </s><s n="s4.8;p3.11">In 1929, for example, 0.1% of Americans had a total income equivalent of the bottom 42%. </s><s n="s5.8;p3.11">Farmers, who accounted for a quarter of the economy, were experiencing a depression in the 1920s following overproduction resulting from World War One, leading to falling prices and farmers' debt. </s><s n="s6.8;p3.11">Government policies such as prohibition and high tariffs meant that not only were they restricted in what they could grow, but also where they could sell their produce. </s><s n="s7.8;p3.11">Industrial workers were also only ever on the fringes of the boom, with wages rising by 8% compared to 80% rises in profits, and two million unemployed throughout the 1920s. </s><s n="s8.8;p3.11">Therefore though the Depression's severity is viewed with surprise by some, if the preceding social situation is examined then it becomes apparent that the foundations of society were never strong enough to uphold the boom for a prolonged period. </s></p><p n="p4.11"><s n="s1.6;p4.11">In addition to this, social trends resulting from World War One increased the severity of the Great Depression, particularly in America. </s><s n="s2.6;p4.11">After the war, consumption trends shifted to new patterns of spending as a "direct result of the secular rise in national income during the 'New Era.'"<ref target="BAWE_0302f-ftnote.005"/> The shift was taking place when the crash intervened, which blocked the economy from sustaining the transition. </s><s n="s3.6;p4.11">Additionally, the transition resulted in the development of new industries such as chemicals and processed foods and the weakening of others such as textiles, iron and steel. </s><s n="s4.6;p4.11">The uneven growth of American industries forestalled economic recovery during the Depression, and so increased its severity. </s><s n="s5.6;p4.11">Furthermore, Hoover's belief in laissez- fair meant that in 1929 Americans had no unemployment insurance or government welfare payments. </s><s n="s6.6;p4.11">When the depression began, therefore, Americans were hit harder than citizens in most European countries due to the social situation in their country at the time. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0302f-ftnote.005"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Bernstein, Michael A, <hi rend="italic">'The Great Depression,'</hi>

Roosevelt. </s><s n="s2.9;p5.11">Though accused of "laissez-faire" policies, Hoover did attempt to stop the depression with policies such as the Smoot- Hawley tariff, though these often did more to hider than help the country's recovery. </s><s n="s3.9;p5.11">As later admitted by Tugwell, one of the architects of Roosevelt's policies of the 1930s, the President "extrapolated [the New Deal] from programs that Hoover started." </s><ref target="BAWE_0302f-ftnote.006"/><s n="s4.9;p5.11">Therefore though often presented as the saviour against the sinner, in reality neither Hoover nor Roosevelt ensured economic recovery; primarily because they failed to adhere to Keynesian economic policies. </s><s n="s5.9;p5.11">Keynes argued that intentionally unbalancing the budget would boost demand to the point where recovery would take place. </s><s n="s6.9;p5.11">Roosevelt was reluctant to accept any increased deficit spending, however, to prevent mass suffering. </s><s n="s7.9;p5.11">In the long term, however, this only "acted as a painkiller rather than a cure for the nation's economic ills." </s><ref target="BAWE_0302f-ftnote.007"/><s n="s8.9;p5.11">Only when the Second World War forced an
