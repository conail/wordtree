revolutionary decade was an important political period in the history of Mexico absorbing a multiplicity of ideological stances. </s><s n="s2.10;p1.8">Relations with the United States of America and the Soviet Union are amongst the factors that built the leftist strand of the revolution as one of its distinct features. </s><s n="s3.10;p1.8">Diplomacy with the Unites States was important in the altering of the character of the revolutionary period and shows the attitude the U.S.A had toward Mexico. </s><s n="s4.10;p1.8">The dynamics of this relationship, and apparent need to cooperate with the United States would be instrumental in the behaviour of the key players in Mexico, causing both the strengthening of leftist sentiment and the later compromise of these leftist principles. </s><s n="s5.10;p1.8">The U.S.A.'s strong leftist bohemian community and their relations with the Mexican people were paramount in the shaping of the Revolution's leftist character. </s><s n="s6.10;p1.8">Key figures helped rectify the perception of Mexico in the U.S and worked actively in Mexico in the encouragement of leftist ideology. </s><s n="s7.10;p1.8">The strained and unclear relationship between the Soviet Union and Mexico illustrates the competing ideologies present in the Mexican Revolution. </s><s n="s8.10;p1.8">The leftist strand resulted in the Soviet Union being considered an exemplar to Mexico whilst other views would result in a tenuous diplomatic relationship between Russia and Mexico. </s><s n="s9.10;p1.8">These relations would also affect relations with the U.S, as Spenser summarises in the title of her latest book, <hi rend="italic">The Impossible Triangle</hi>. </s><s n="s10.10;p1.8">Whilst relations with these two countries were important, key figures within Mexico

significant in this process. </s><s n="s3.7;p2.8">The impact of these characters is illustrated on the affect they had on each other. </s><s n="s4.7;p2.8">Joseph remarks that 'Carrillo was influenced by the anti capitalist doctrine that pervaded <hi rend="italic">Zapatismo</hi> in 1914-1915'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.001"/> Roy remarks on the presence of Zapata in that 'even beyond the

liberal views, some of them were professional socialist, and a few anarchists'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.002"/> Yucatán under Felipe Carrillo Puerto provides another good instance of the leftist ideology forming from within the country. </s><s n="s5.7;p2.8">Joseph describes his shrewd activity noting that he was a 'socialist committed to profound structural change, he remained adept at working through the maze of formal and informal political networks'.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.003"/> Economic structural problems and political problems especially, Diaz's ruthlessness fuelled the grievances the intelligentsia, peasants and workers had against the Diaz regime resulting in left wing ideas, especially around meeting the demand of peasants and working class<ref

of the revolution.<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.005"/> The Constitution of 1917 can be seen as the culmination of these demands and representing the leftist success of the revolution as it 'legalized principles of social justice, such as common ownership'<ref target="BAWE_0314i-ftnote.006"/>. </s><s n="s7.7;p2.8">The culmination can be seen in that on the establishment of the 1917 Constitution

attitude was used to contrast with that of Mexico strengthening the resolve of the left in Mexico and their drive to shape the country in this manner. </s><s n="s5.9;p3.8">Historically, the Mexican's
