although even he must have known that Castro's low approval rating played a vital role. </s><s n="s13.15;p5.13">Historian Fairline's approach to studying Kennedy more fully encompasses the role of Robert Kennedy than many other studies, and Fairline suggests that Robert Kennedy's desire to kill Castro was a character flaw that rubbed off onto the President. </s><s n="s14.15;p5.13">Kennedy didn't want to appear as just another liberal, and yet his failure to kill Castro alienated the right. </s><s n="s15.15;p5.13">Peace movements would also lose faith in Kennedy, whom they had hoped would support forces representing peasants. </s></p><p n="p6.13"><s n="s1.5;p6.13">It could be argued that a President is often judged on major events during his time in office, and that discussion often overlooks the more discrete decisions that are made away from fervent public discussion. </s><s n="s2.5;p6.13">One argument in favour of Kennedy is that his time in office was dominated by the Cold War and that, as Commander-in-Chief, he took on a lot of responsibility during well-documented moments in what we now know as history. </s><s n="s3.5;p6.13">The discussions over Laotian neutrality represent an example of Presidential involvement out of the public eye. </s><s n="s4.5;p6.13">Yet the American-Soviet deal to neutralise Laos sparked historical argument because Kennedy appeared to have changed position having told a reporter before the Bay of Pigs that he would go to war in Laos. </s><s n="s5.5;p6.13">The jury is still out on this issue, Rorabaugh arguing Kennedy, unconfident in military advice, looked toward a non-military solution, learning from the Bay of Pigs fiasco. </s></p><p n="p7.13"><s n="s1.10;p7.13">In early June 1961, Kennedy and Khrushchev would meet in Vienna for a summit regarding a nuclear test ban. </s><s n="s2.10;p7.13">Lawrence Freedman writes and excellent account of the event, highlighting Kennedy's personal fatigues as well as the overall negative result of the meeting. </s><s n="s3.10;p7.13">Consumed with good PR concerning the space race, Kennedy's desire to promise the American people that the US would triumph perhaps blinded the President from the truth. </s><s n="s4.10;p7.13">As Freedman notes, little thought had been given to policy implications of actually being ahead.<ref target="BAWE_0322h-ftnote.004"/> Despite the talk of outer space, what Kennedy was really doing was pushing the missile gap thesis harder and harder. </s><s n="s5.10;p7.13">Debate had raged concerning whether any gap existed by 1961, but the Americans were certainly catching up fast. </s><s n="s6.10;p7.13">Khrushchev saw Kennedy as "young, inexperienced and apparently inept" following the summit and Freedman argues this was down to a lack of faith on Kennedy's part regarding his own position. </s><s n="s7.10;p7.13">Despite the Communist position crumbling in Berlin, a jet-lagged Kennedy entered into an unconfident ideological debate with Khrushchev, ignoring his advisors warnings not to. </s><s n="s8.10;p7.13">Test Ban discussion would prove more successful in 1963, but in Vienna, Khrushchev had applied his own personal pressure on an inexperienced Kennedy and no positive outcome had been reached. </s><s n="s9.10;p7.13">Peace activists were unhappy at the outcome. </s><s n="s10.10;p7.13">However, much information regarding the summit was kept from public view until 1990 and so good PR may have assisted many of Kennedy's failings. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0322h-ftnote.004"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Lawrence Freedman, Kennedy's Wars (US, 2000) p46 </s></p></note><p n="p8.13"><s n="s1.14;p8.13">Much has been written of the Cuban Missile Crisis since its tense occurrence in October 1962. </s><s n="s2.14;p8.13">Praise for the way Kennedy acted to resolve the crisis was rife at the time. </s><s n="s3.14;p8.13">Commentators of the time highlighted Kennedy's decision making as crucial and it would appear they held a fair view. </s><s n="s4.14;p8.13">The nation feared that invasion of Cuba would lead to a catastrophic war, and yet Kennedy would be politically reviled if he did nothing. </s><s n="s5.14;p8.13">When Khrushchev agreed to remove missiles from their bases in Cuba, the sheer relief throughout America was enough in itself to hand Kennedy a 'victory.' </s><s n="s6.14;p8.13">Vice President Lyndon Johnson praised his poker style abilities in such a fearful moment. </s><s n="s7.14;p8.13">Yet, despite this supposed 'victory,' historians now debate whether Kennedy deserves such a reputation for his role in the Missile Crisis. </s><s n="s8.14;p8.13">James L.
