In terms of physical engineering design, problems of mounting experimental equipment within the tank were explored fully and solved, allowing for a greater knowledge of how to complete experiments in the future. These could either be done using the equipment produced, or using ideas explored in this project's equipment design. A high aspect of experimental work and theory was also applied in this project, which are essential skills in all engineering fields. This is because in order to further knowledge of certain concepts within engineering, it has to be ensured that previous knowledge is fully understood, which then puts the user in a position to increase this understanding.</p><p>This project is very relevant to engineering due to the information gained from it. The relationships between vortex rings and a free surface may have future relevance to commercial engineering applications such as in products such as aircraft that produce a large amount of lift. However, until this knowledge can be applied to commercial applications there is a high value in simply learning about under what circumstances the observed effects apply.</p><p>This project should be considered an achievement because it has used a wide range of engineering techniques in order to investigate a specific aim of determining the influence of a free surface on a vortex ring travelling parallel to it. It should also be considered an achievement due to the fact that a certain degree of useful results have been found and analysed in evidence to the specification of the project. However, one weakness of the project is that the results are not entirely conclusive about when a vortex ring will not be affected by a free surface anymore. This would have been achieved if further experiments could have been done.</p></div1></front><body><div1 type="abstract"><head>1.0 Summary</head><p n="p1.141"><s n="s1.1;p1.141">The aim of this

in water by the movement of a piston, and are visualised using a dye, rather than through the use of smoke. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head>4.0 Literature Review</head><p n="p9.141"><s

n="s2.4;p9.141">Initially, basic methods such as allowing "a drop of water, lightly colored (sic) with milk or food dye, to fall from an eye-dropper or a burette into a glass of water" (Shariff, 1992) were used. </s><s n="s3.4;p9.141">As technology increased more technical and repeatable techniques were developed, producing the method of pushing fluid through a nozzle using a piston. </s><s

formed in the laboratory, they are occasionally formed in nature, such as from volcanoes in the form of smoke rings, or even by dolphins in the form of air rings. </s><s n="s2.2;p10.141">Figure 4.1

Condensate (Anderson, Haljan, Regal, Feder, Collins, Clark, Cornell). </s><s n="s2.2;p11.141">This is an example of how "accelerating ions in superfluid helium create quantized vortex rings" as stated in (Shariff, 1992). </s></p><p n="p12.141"><s n="s1.5;p12.141">The technique of vortex ring production, where fluid is pushed through a nozzle is the most commonly used, as it is fairly simple to produce and has a high degree of repeatability. </s><s n="s2.5;p12.141">The reason that pushing fluid through a nozzle produces a vortex ring is that "a blob of fluid emerges from the hole", which then "rolls up into the form of an oblate spheroid owing to the self-induction of the vorticity produced at the edge of the hole." </s><s n="s3.5;p12.141">(Maxworthy, 1974) or as described by (Glezer, 1988) "The flow separates at the edge of the orifice and a cylindrical vortex sheet forms and rolls up into a vortex ring." </s><s n="s4.5;p12.141">A model of this self-similar roll-up is described by Shariff and then modelled and computed to an extent, by Nitsche and Krasny (1994), that photos of actual roll-up and computed roll-up would be fairly difficult to identify from one another by eye. </s><s n="s5.5;p12.141">The vortex ring formation process is also modelled to a high extent more recently by Mohseni, Ran, and Colonius (2001). </s></p><p n="p13.141"><s n="s1.1;p13.141">Many different aspects of vortex rings have been investigated which include the factors that determine whether a ring is laminar or turbulent, the properties of these forms, interactions between vortex rings and other bodies, and also visually appealing phenomena such as leapfrogging of rings. </s></p><p n="p14.141"><s n="s1.4;p14.141">In 1987 Glezer examined the factors which determine whether a

separating vortex rings that are turbulent upon formation from those that are not" (Glezer, 1988) was produced. </s><s n="s3.4;p14.141">This was important because a range of dimensionless parameters were formed which allow for translation onto other similar experiments, which do not necessarily use the same geometries. </s><s n="s4.4;p14.141">Glezer states that his experimental set up has

would be either laminar or turbulent on formation. </s><s n="s2.10;p15.141">This is important because the properties of laminar and turbulent rings are inherently different from one another. </s><s n="s3.10;p15.141">Shariff discusses the properties of laminar and turbulent rings to a high extent in his paper 'Vortex Rings'. </s><s n="s4.10;p15.141">Essentially, a turbulent vortex ring can be described as "a compact turbulent region with net linear momentum, statistically invariant with respect to rotation about one axis" (Shariff, 1988) Vortex rings can not only be turbulent initially upon formation, but a laminar vortex ring can also become turbulent. </s><s n="s5.10;p15.141">Maxworthy suggests that this is due to an azimuthal instability within the ring core. </s><s n="s6.10;p15.141">The conditions that determine whether a vortex ring changes from laminar to turbulent, and possibly back again, depends, according to Maxworthy (1972), on its Renold's number. </s><s n="s7.10;p15.141">At low values, a laminar ring will continue its movement until the edge of a tank or another boundary is reached. </s><s n="s8.10;p15.141">At a Renold's number of greater than 600, an azimuthal instability will occur, yet the ring will not transform into a turbulent state. </s><s n="s9.10;p15.141">For higher values of Renold's number, Maxworthy states that in his observations a ring would gain an azimuthal instability and then "the wavy structure collapsed into a turbulent blob and the vorticity was effectively cancelled by turbulent diffusion" (Maxworthy, 1972). </s><s n="s10.10;p15.141">At very large values of Renold's number the ring would become turbulent, an "apparently disorganised vorticity field" (Maxworthy, 1972), and from this a new vortex ring was formed. </s></p><p n="p16.141"><s n="s1.4;p16.141">These studies of vortex rings are relevant to the project at hand, due to the fact that the form of vortex ring is relevant to its subsequent activity.

concerned with the interactions between a vortex ring and objects that are placed in its way. </s><s n="s4.4;p16.141">D.

have also been fired towards a wall normal to its axis in order to investigate the effects of the wall on the ring as it draws closer to it, as it collides with it, and after it collides with it. </s><s n="s2.4;p17.141">Boldes and Ferreri in 'Behaviour of vortex rings in the vicinity of a wall' investigated this to quite a high extent. </s><s n="s3.4;p17.141">In this it was discovered that a

numerical modelling. </s><s n="s2.8;p20.141">However, there seems to be a lack in a combination of the two. </s><s n="s3.8;p20.141">This may be due to the fact that in order to do this, a specialisation in both computer and practical techniques would be needed. </s><s n="s4.8;p20.141">It is important to draw on both models and real-life tests because an effective computer model represents a fairly good understanding of the topic at hand. </s><s n="s5.8;p20.141">However, to know that it is an effective model, it should be compared to what actually happens. </s><s n="s6.8;p20.141">An example of this is the above Figure 4.2. </s><s n="s7.8;p20.141">From observation during this project, the figure can be seen to be visually fairly representative of the true situation, however there is little reference to this within Yue's paper. </s><s n="s8.8;p20.141">One paper that makes good use of a comparison between experimental and numerical studies is by Nitsche

studies given use similar apparatus in order to do the same experiments, a piston-cylinder-nozzle arrangement is used. </s><s n="s2.6;p21.141">Glezer made an attempt to standardise this in 1988, as stated previously, by which time many of these similar experiments had been done. </s><s n="s3.6;p21.141">It would have seemed wise to attempt to standardise this at an earlier date. </s><s

explained by the statement that it a "certain unique piece of apparatus existed at each one (location) that could not be conveniently reassembled or manufactured in a common place." </s><s n="s6.6;p21.141">(Maxworthy, 1977) Even though this is understandable due to time and money constraints, it could have been an opportunity to standardise this apparatus, due to the relevance and scale
