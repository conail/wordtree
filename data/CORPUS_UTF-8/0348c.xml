we got along well and came up with several good ideas to work with; one of which looked particularly encouraging. </s><s n="s5.10;p1.7">I was a McGregor's Theory Y type manager which worked well as the team responded to a degree of autonomy with responsible attitudes. </s><s n="s6.10;p1.7">However my performance after the initial month started suffering. </s><s n="s7.10;p1.7">This was due to poor time management, taking on too many responsibilities and poor prioritisation. </s><s n="s8.10;p1.7">I also found it difficult to research market conditions. </s><s n="s9.10;p1.7">I left things until the last minute (due to disorganisation) and then found it difficult to ask others for help. </s><s n="s10.10;p1.7">With hindsight this could clearly have been overcome with greater organisational skills, recording deadlines and starting well in advance of them. </s></p><p n="p2.7"><s n="s1.8;p2.7">Despite this I was able to support Team Members A and B, (I shall refer to them as Members A-D and myself for anonymity and consistency) who carried out the Upper Level Pitch by working with them on their presentation skills. </s><s n="s2.8;p2.7">I recorded their practices and offered constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement. </s><s n="s3.8;p2.7">It went very well: we got a good first. </s><s n="s4.8;p2.7">I decided to stand down as group leader at this point because Member A had emerged as a natural leader and I felt it would make more sense to allow him to excel in this role than continue in this role to the detriment of the team. </s><s n="s5.8;p2.7">Member A was the Coordinator in Belbin's Team Inventory model, whereas I was more of a Monitor Evaluator, rendering him more suited to the leadership role. </s><s n="s6.8;p2.7">He also had the Gallup Management Strengths Finder characteristics of Discipline and Maximizer: this was reflected in excellent organisational skills and clarity of his demands. </s><s n="s7.8;p2.7">Member A allocated us tasks to carry out over the Christmas holidays. </s><s n="s8.8;p2.7">I think the reality of peer assessments (offering either a harsh rebuttal or encouragement to continue) gave us all incentive to work hard during the break. </s></p><p n="p3.7"><s n="s1.6;p3.7">Having learnt my lesson, I put considerable effort into my assignments. </s><s n="s2.6;p3.7">One of my tasks was to write the Curriculum Vitae of the Chief Executive Officer and the Technical Director. </s><s n="s3.6;p3.7">I found this particularly rewarding. </s><s n="s4.6;p3.7">Perhaps I spent a bit too long researching their experience and making sure it was all feasible and factually exacting, but forging backgrounds for these two high flyers made me consider that I need to be doing more in pursuit of personal excellence. </s><s n="s5.6;p3.7">Consequently, I have begun to seriously undertake completion of extra curricular goals, I will embark on a two month placement at a Global Civil Engineering firm this Summer and I am currently writing a five year plan to aid me in reaching the pinnacle of my abilities annually and raising the bar just as frequently. </s><s n="s6.6;p3.7">Furthermore I have decided to narrow the scope of my activities so I can dedicate more time and commitment to each activity. </s></p><p n="p4.7"><s n="s1.7;p4.7">There was a definite shift in the dynamics of the team after the Upper Level Pitch. </s><s n="s2.7;p4.7">Team Member C and I worked considerably harder, whilst Team Member D reduced his efforts. </s><s n="s3.7;p4.7">(Team Members A and B worked hard for the duration of the project.) </s><s n="s4.7;p4.7">Team Member D was an envisioner: he had excellent ideas at the beginning of the project, but he struggled in developing these ideas after the Upper Level Pitch. </s><s n="s5.7;p4.7">This did not create any slack in the group; as I discovered on this project, I have some of the tendencies of an enabler and I am definitely an enactor. </s><s n="s6.7;p4.7">I derived great satisfaction from helping to shape our original, vague ideas into the tangible and credible form of a Business Plan. </s><s n="s7.7;p4.7">As someone that possesses the Gallup Management Strengths Finder Analytical characteristic I was able to improve the Business Plan overall by challenging each member to back up ideas in the Business Plan with facts and figures. </s></p><p n="p5.7"><s n="s1.5;p5.7">As a team we seemed to possess most of Belbin's team roles. </s><s n="s2.5;p5.7">However, we did not initially tap into the Specialist attributes of Team Member C. He studies an Accounting and Finance module at the Business School. </s><s n="s3.5;p5.7">Had the team taken advantage of this earlier on we may have performed even better on the Upper Level Pitch. </s><s n="s4.5;p5.7">This was rectified in time for the Business Plan where he produced some excellent financial data. </s><s n="s5.5;p5.7">In retrospect I would have requested that all team members, within the first week made a short list of their talents and interests so that what we could bring to the team was outlined at the offset. </s></p><p n="p6.7"><s n="s1.2;p6.7">The written English of two Team Members was not particularly good so I volunteered to rewrite the Financial Report that Team Member C had written (,changing the linguistic composition rather than content). </s><s n="s2.2;p6.7">I feel that this is a good example of team work: his financial acumen (he takes a module at the Business School) and my literary skills combined to form a better financial report than either of us could have produced alone. </s></p><p n="p7.7"><s n="s1.6;p7.7">I learnt a great deal about the entrepreneurial process from this project. </s><s n="s2.6;p7.7">The initial idea generation stage was the one in which I encountered the most difficulty. </s><s n="s3.6;p7.7">The kind of ingenuity required at this innovative stage is very difficult to develop, however, if I was to undertake this project again I would go through the stages of my day and reflect on things which annoy me because of their inefficiency and seek solutions to these issues. </s><s n="s4.6;p7.7">I would also try and do this from the viewpoint of others in different positions. </s><s n="s5.6;p7.7">I have further learnt that organisation is imperative to personal and team progression. </s><s n="s6.6;p7.7">I have discovered different means of leading a group from my experience and observing Team Member A. I have found this project very useful and informative. </s></p></div1></body><back/></text></TEI.2>
