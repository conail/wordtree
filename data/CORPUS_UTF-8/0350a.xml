"The Parliament and Government in Reconstructed Germany" shows remarkable similarities between the parliament of Germany after the resignation of Bismarck, and the legislative council in Hong Kong before and after the handover. </s><s n="s3.3;p3.36">Finally, after the People's Republic of China government rejected universal suffrage for the 2007 Chief Executive election in Hong Kong, claiming that the city was not ready for full democracy as it lacked the necessary political talent; people in Hong Kong started to have the same outcry as Weber did in the post World War I Germany, "What was lacking was the direction of the state by a politician - not by a political genius, to be expected only once every few centuries, not even by a great political talent, but simply by a politician" (ES 1405). </s></p><p n="p4.36"><s n="s1.7;p4.36">Where should we go to look for politicians? </s><s n="s2.7;p4.36">The first "politician" was elected (by an 800-people Election Committee) to be the Chief Executive of Hong Kong in 2005. </s><s n="s3.7;p4.36">The elected Chief Executive Donald Tsang had been serving the government as a civil servant for his entire career. </s><s n="s4.7;p4.36">When Mr. Tsang announced his candidacy and filled in his Chief Executive Nomination Form, he declared himself to be a "politician"(SCMP<ref target="BAWE_0350a-ftnote.003"/> a). </s><s n="s5.7;p4.36">His declaration of turning into a politician caught the city by surprise, but such a turn of event would never gain the approval of Max Weber as well. </s><s n="s6.7;p4.36">Weber made clear distinctions between the career of civil servants and that of politicians, with one of the roles of a politician being to combat the ever expanding influence of bureaucracy. </s><s n="s7.7;p4.36">For Weber, the two careers could only be in contest instead of harmony. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0350a-ftnote.003"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Abbreviation of "South China Morning Post". </s></p></note><p n="p5.36"><s n="s1.6;p5.36">Although the days of Weber and Hong Kong are a century apart, Weber and the people in Hong Kong had the same demand for political leaders. </s><s n="s2.6;p5.36">However, in contrast to the ideologies of Weber, Hong Kong depends on the bureaucracy for the supply of politicians. </s><s n="s3.6;p5.36">Why is the "transgression" from bureaucracy to politicians approved, or even appreciated in Hong Kong? </s><s n="s4.6;p5.36">What are the implications and consequences of such a transgression? </s><s n="s5.6;p5.36">In the first part of this paper, I will analyse the executive-legislative relationship of Hong Kong governance in light of the political writings of Weber. </s><s n="s6.6;p5.36">In the second part of the paper, I will present the argument that there are peculiar internal and external factors which "apoliticalise" the city, and these factors lead to the preference of officialdom instead of true politicians to be in charge of the city. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined bold">The paradox of bureaucracy</head><p n="p6.36"><s n="s1.5;p6.36">Weber regarded the establishment of bureaucracy as the watershed between the traditional and modern society due to the characters of "rationality" inherited to the bureaucratic structures (Hindess 1987). </s><s n="s2.5;p6.36">Rationality is the central theme of the sociological thoughts of Weber, which concerns the "logic in rational social action itself whereby the world and society become increasingly more predictable, more susceptible to control, more formalised, more reducible to rational means-ends calculation" (Breiner 1996: 133). </s><s n="s3.5;p6.36">Bureaucracy is the objectification of the spirit of rationality in the modern society.The fulfillment of bureaucracy towards rationality explained the machine's domination in the modern world. </s><s n="s4.5;p6.36">However, the positive account of bureaucracy only forms one of the different aspects of bureaucracy in Weber's writings. </s><s n="s5.5;p6.36">If we turn to the political writings of Weber, we will see a more critical account of the mechanism of bureaucracy, which has its own danger and weakness (Beetham 1974). </s></p><p n="p7.36"><s n="s1.5;p7.36">Combining the strength and weakness of the system, Weber provides us with several paradoxes of the bureaucratic mechanism. </s><s n="s2.5;p7.36">Firstly, bureaucracy is a powerful creature that is ever expanding, and it is irresistible and irreversible for modern life; however the system can also be fragile and will "fail completely" (ES 1417) whenever it is expected to deal with political problems. </s><s n="s3.5;p7.36">Secondly, the technical superiority of bureaucracy aids people to realize their expanding desires and satisfactions in the complex society; however the "impersonal character" of the system also leads to the "expropriation of the means of power" (FMW 82), and the lost of mankind's liberty. </s><s n="s4.5;p7.36">Lastly, bureaucracy is merely a machine that works according to documented rules and regulations; however this technical instrument will in turn "grow" out the soul of its own, to the point that it becomes a separate force in society, capable of influencing the other sectors of civilisation. </s><s n="s5.5;p7.36">In the following, I will use the political situation of Hong Kong to illustrate these paradoxes. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined bold">The powerful bureaucratic machine</head><p n="p8.36"><s n="s1.5;p8.36">As I have explained previously, the strengths of bureaucracy echo with the "Hong Kong spirit" that the local people are proud of. </s><s n="s2.5;p8.36">The efficient team of civil servants is regarded as one of the bases that guarantees the continuity of "prosperity and stability" of the city. </s><s n="s3.5;p8.36">Under the principle of "One Country, Two Systems", the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region inherited wholesale the political- administrative structure from the previous colonial regime. </s><s n="s4.5;p8.36">This unusual measure of a post-colonial government indicated that the bureaucracy, which played an important role in Hong Kong governance during the colonial era, would continue to dominate in the post- colonial Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Lam 2005). </s><s n="s5.5;p8.36">The result of such a strong and massive official team is an "executive-led" government, at the expense of a relatively incapable legislative council. </s></p><p n="p9.36"><s n="s1.4;p9.36">Many parallels can be recognised when we compare the bureaucratic structure depicted by Weber in theory and that of Hong Kong in reality. </s><s n="s2.4;p9.36">The day-to-day business of government is carried out by approximately 160,000 civil servants within the 67 departments, which are under the direction of 11 bureaus. </s><s n="s3.4;p9.36">The number of these departments has been steadily expanding over the past decades due to the increase of complexity and specialisation of the administration, and also the government's increasing involvement in social welfare. </s><s n="s4.4;p9.36">For example, the Medical and Health Department was divided into the Hospital Services Department and the Department of Health in 1989 (Miners 1991). </s></p><p n="p10.36"><s n="s1.6;p10.36">According to Weber, neutrality and equality are the key features of bureaucracy. </s><s n="s2.6;p10.36">These two values refer to a regular and structured system, where officials are responsible to the ranks instead of the person in charge; and the salary and ranking of the officials is tightly related to their seniority. </s><s n="s3.6;p10.36">These values are also highly emphasised in the team of civil servants in Hong Kong. </s><s n="s4.6;p10.36">Public administration is a career path which is open to almost everyone. </s><s n="s5.6;p10.36">The recruitment of the most promising rank in the government, the Administrative Officer (who can proceed to the leading position in the government) is basically open to all, with the minimum requirement of 5 passes in the GCSE and a university degree, regardless of discipline. </s><s n="s6.6;p10.36">Furthermore, the relatively generous package of salary and fringe benefits in addition to the structured increment system are all measures to guarantee the neutrality and impartiality of the team. </s></p><p n="p11.36"><s n="s1.9;p11.36">The extreme professionalism among civil servants is guaranteed by the division of labour and the complicated recruitment procedures. </s><s n="s2.9;p11.36">Despite the relatively lax application requirements, the applicants for the position of Administrative Officer have to attend two written tests and two other interviews in order to be selected. </s><s n="s3.9;p11.36">Despite the massive amount (over thousands) of applications, only 10 to 30 people will be selected every year. </s><s n="s4.9;p11.36">Besides, more specific definitions of responsibility among different departments and different rank of office were also introduced along the expansion of the government. </s><s n="s5.9;p11.36">In 1972 the McKinsey Report suggested that the government should be restructured with the introduction of new policy branches (Lam 2005, Miners 1991). </s><s n="s6.9;p11.36">From then on, a clear-cut division of labour has been confirmed between the secretaries and the heads of departments. </s><s n="s7.9;p11.36">The department heads are responsible for day-to-day operations; while the secretaries have the overseeing responsibilities (Miners 1991). </s><s n="s8.9;p11.36">Except for the Administrative Officers who follow a 3 to 5 years of office rotation, the rest of the officials in the government stay in the same office until retirement. </s><s n="s9.9;p11.36">The arrangement further reinforces the specialisation in the roles that they play in the bureaucratic machine. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined bold">The dangerous bureaucratic machine </head><p n="p12.36"><s n="s1.2;p12.36">Despite the ever-expanding power of bureaucracy, Weber argued that once the bureaucracy is set in the social and the political context, the system will start to reveal its danger and weakness that we may not be able to realise at the beginning. </s><s n="s2.2;p12.36">In the later political works of Weber, he depicted the danger of the domination of bureaucracy in the society, and the potential weakness of the system when it is dealing with political circumstances. </s></p><p n="p13.36"><s n="s1.7;p13.36">The danger of bureaucracy is stemmed from the "professionalism" within the system. </s><s n="s2.7;p13.36">The feature of professionalism allows the bureaucratic machine to "monopolise" the information that is not accessible to the public. </s><s n="s3.7;p13.36">Weber distinguished the difference between the information of "technical know-how" and the official information (ES 1417), which the bureaucracy both tried to conceal in order to hide its actions from criticism and to protect the group against supervision of any exterior power. </s><s n="s4.7;p13.36">The "technical know-how" refers to the knowledge they acquired through specialised training and the precise division of labour; the "official knowledge" refers to the concrete information relevant to the officials' performance, which is only available to the officials through the means of "administration apparatus" (Beetham 1974: 74). </s><s n="s5.7;p13.36">As a result, according to Weber, "The political master always finds himself, vis-à-vis the trained official, in the position of a dilettante facing the expert" (ES 991). </s><s n="s6.7;p13.36">Ultimately, in the modern states, the actual ruler is necessarily and unavoidably the bureaucracy, since "power is exercised neither through parliamentary speeches nor monarchial enunciations but through the routines of administration." </s><s n="s7.7;p13.36">(ES 1393) </s></p><p n="p14.36"><s n="s1.3;p14.36">The measures of secrecy help to preserve the interests of the officials and also allow them to exert a status of superiority. </s><s n="s2.3;p14.36">The bureaucrats consider the parliament as merely the "arenas for mere speech making"(ES 1419). </s><s n="s3.3;p14.36">Even the monarch is depending more and more on the advice of the bureaucracy to rule, and ultimately submits himself under the bureaucratic control, said Weber, "(the officials) can enjoy the privilege of operating without controls or without being accountable to anybody" (ES 1407). </s></p><p n="p15.36"><s n="s1.3;p15.36">The domination of bureaucracy is further accelerated under the influence of Bismarck in Germany after unification in 1871. </s><s n="s2.3;p15.36">In "Parliament and Government in a Reconstructed Germany", Weber concluded that the lack of political talents and the weak parliament was mostly contributed by the "Bismarckian Legacy" (Eliaeson 2000: 134). </s><s n="s3.3;p15.36">Weber resented Bismarck's internal policies which aimed at curtailing the power of German parliament, in order to achieve a "political impotent parliament and political leadership" (ES 1388). </s></p><p n="p16.36"><s n="s1.4;p16.36">Bureaucracy thus could develop to its fullest under the blessing of Bismarck, and the consequence was devastating. </s><s n="s2.4;p16.36">Under the domination of bureaucracy, the German parliament could only enact in the name of public power by approving the government budget, or introducing "unenforceable motions" or rejecting appropriation (ES 1407). </s><s n="s3.4;p16.36">Weber described how such an incapable parliament was only enacting "negative politics"; and the parliament was useless, time-consuming and annoying in the eyes of the administration. </s><s n="s4.4;p16.36">Besides, the powerless parliament became a place for the demagogues instead of true political talents with a zest to serve, as Weber explained, "in face of powerless parliament... only a fool will venture into this miserable web of mutual resentment" (ES 1413). </s></p><p n="p17.36"><s n="s1.4;p17.36">The influence of Bismarck was absent in Hong Kong, but the pre- and post- colonial constitution has also been threatening the development of the Legislative Council (Legco) of the city. </s><s n="s2.4;p17.36">An executive-led government is characterised by the domination of civil servants who hold most of the power over bill initiation and policy making (Ming 2004). </s><s n="s3.4;p17.36">The Legco did not have any representatives from direct election until 1985, when the "functional constituency<ref target="BAWE_0350a-ftnote.004"/>" was introduced to the legislative council. </s><s n="s4.4;p17.36">Nowadays, the legislative council consists of 60 members, half of them remain to be elected through the functional constituency;
