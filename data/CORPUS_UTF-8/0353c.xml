early stage. </s><s n="s3.13;p136.144">Many organizations may be concerned about the impact of Internet on its traditional industry. </s><s n="s4.13;p136.144">As Gates (2000) pointed out, this situation is similar to when the telephone was first introduced. </s><s n="s5.13;p136.144">Many critics viewed it as a threat to society, personal privacy and individual behavior. </s><s

greatest invention, as it did benefit many organizations and individuals and accelerated the world economy. </s><s n="s8.13;p136.144">However, from others point of view, Internet will result in economic and cultural exploitation, the death of privacy. </s><s n="s9.13;p136.144">Everything has its two sides. </s><s n="s10.13;p136.144">For example, although more and more people are turning to use e-mail to contact others, the traditional express companies still hold its market share and make profit. </s><s n="s11.13;p136.144">On the other hand, many express companies have already had their own websites and expanded their marketplace worldwide by using Internet. </s><s n="s12.13;p136.144">The important thing is that the Internet is impacting on the society and economy in a positive way, and it will not shake the fundamental aspects of business and social framework. </s><s n="s13.13;p136.144">However, the current argument on how widely the Internet should be adopted does raise some serious issues that must be addressed to make the most of the Internet's vast potential (Gates, 2000). </s></p><p n="p137.144"><s n="s1.5;p137.144">Protecting intellectual property: Nowadays, Internet

n="s3.5;p137.144">The software industry, publishing industry, and the audio-visual industry have been struggling with this issue in recent years. </s><s n="s4.5;p137.144">Therefore, strong legislation such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) has been issued to prevent or deter piracy. </s><s n="s5.5;p137.144">However, as the digital information is easy to distribute over the Internet, the government and organizations should work together and protect the intellectual property in appropriate ways (Gates, 2000). </s></p><p n="p138.144"><s n="s1.3;p138.144">Regulating global commerce: As the Internet offers businesses and individuals an easy way to transactions, it is accelerating economic growth in the world. </s><s n="s2.3;p138.144">However, it brings more challenges to tax and price regulation. </s><s n="s3.3;p138.144">To avoid vicious competition and regulate the online transaction, government and businesses must cooperate to find effective ways to resolve this issue. </s></p><p n="p139.144"><s n="s1.6;p139.144">Protecting individual privacy: E-security, as it is mentioned in the above section, is arousing more and more attention. </s><s n="s2.6;p139.144">Along with the developing of Internet, people will increasingly rely on it to share information like making a purchase and payment online and checking medical history. </s><s n="s3.6;p139.144">The financial risk does exist in online transaction and it is a threat to individual privacy. </s><s n="s4.6;p139.144">As many people are required by retailers to submit their personal account information when making purchasing online, some of them may concern about the safety of their account details, and will be reluctant to trust the Internet. </s><s n="s5.6;p139.144">This will eventually lead to the decline of sales. </s><s n="s6.6;p139.144">Therefore, more e-technology should be applied in the future to avoid online transaction fraud and protect individual privacy. </s></p><p n="p140.144"><s n="s1.3;p140.144">Keeping the Internet secure: Web site hacking, credit card fraud and identity theft have affected the Internets reputation. </s><s n="s2.3;p140.144">In order to keep the Internet a safe place to do business, e-security barrier must be overcome as soon as possible. </s><s n="s3.3;p140.144">Software companies should take the responsibility to offer high-tech products for keeping the Internet secure. </s></p><p n="p141.144"><s n="s1.6;p141.144">Protecting children: The Internet is transforming the traditional education system, which gives children more opportunity to know the world. </s><s n="s2.6;p141.144">However, it can also expose them to obscene, violent or inappropriate content. </s><s n="s3.6;p141.144">In reality, it is difficult to censor this unregulated global medium. </s><s n="s4.6;p141.144">While parents and teachers can block access to objectionable Web sites through advanced software. </s><s n="s5.6;p141.144">Meanwhile, government should encourage software companies to produce more child-safety e-tools. </s><s n="s6.6;p141.144">Law enforcement also plays an important role in prosecuting
