supplies and water-related disease in semi-arid areas such as the grasslands of Africa, North East China, The Mediterranean and parts of Australia will be affected by the changes is investigated in this report. </s><s n="s3.8;p1.13">The water supply in these areas will be diminished by changes in precipitation, evaporation and soil moisture, river flows and groundwater re-charge which occur due to the rising temperature. </s><s n="s4.8;p1.13">Food production will be greatly affected by the unpredictable nature of the weather with changing seasons, high rainfall, floods, and droughts all featuring. </s><s n="s5.8;p1.13">These factors also greatly influence the spread of disease. </s><s n="s6.8;p1.13">Water-borne disease can be brought about either by contamination brought on by flooding or the use of poor quality, contaminated freshwater during a drought. </s><s n="s7.8;p1.13">Flooding and the temperate nature of semi-arid countries will facilitate mosquitoes which aids the spread of malaria, yellow fever and dengue. </s><s n="s8.8;p1.13">Through flooding malaria could be transmitted to areas to dryer areas where it did not figure before as conditions were not favourable to mosquitoes, which creates the risk of a malaria epidemic. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head>Introduction</head><p n="p2.13"><s n="s1.6;p2.13">The Earth's climate is a major factor in the way that people across the world live their lives. </s><s n="s2.6;p2.13">Due to man's activities, particularly with respect to carbon pollution, a mean global temperature rise of 2º is now almost a certainty and this will impact hugely on everyone in the world. </s><s n="s3.6;p2.13">Particularly crucial to human survival is how the temperature increase will affect the water supply as fresh water will become scarce. </s><s n="s4.6;p2.13">Semi-arid areas such as the grasslands of Africa, North East China, The Mediterranean and parts of Australia are very susceptible due to their very nature and as these areas cover one-third of the Earth's surface, accommodating 900 million people, it is a very important issue. </s><s n="s5.6;p2.13">Global warming will affect the water supply by altering precipitation, evaporation and soil moisture, river flows and groundwater re-charge which will in turn affect diseases for which water is involved. </s><s n="s6.6;p2.13">Specifically how these will be affected is detailed below. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head>Precipitation</head><p n="p3.13"><s n="s1.13;p3.13">Precipitation is the main cause of variability in water balance over space and time and in semi-arid countries it is generally low already and highly seasonal.<ref target="BAWE_0363b-endnote.001"/> The change in climate is predicted, according to simulation studies to reduce precipitation in the African monsoon, reduce precipitation all year round in the Mediterranean and increase rainfall in the Asian monsoon.<ref target="BAWE_0363b-endnote.002"/> In all of these areas, the variability of the rainfall is set to increase. </s><s n="s2.13;p3.13">Different areas have varying rainy seasons and different levels of rainfall but the people are all well adapted to this and base their agricultural methods upon it. </s><s n="s3.13;p3.13">For the success of farming, factors such as the timing of the first rains (when affects when the crops are planted), distribution of the rains within the growing season and the effectiveness of the rains are all very important.<ref target="BAWE_0363b-endnote.003"/> However, due to global warming, rainfall will become more erratic and rainy seasons will tend to become shorter and less predictable without trend and this uncertainty will in turn affect crop yields. </s><s n="s4.13;p3.13">Drought is another element that people have come to cope with, as in many instances it is predictable and they can therefore work around them, however with the changes in the climate, there will be little or no trend. </s><s n="s5.13;p3.13">On the other extreme, due to the erratic nature of the rainfall, there is risk of flooding. </s><s n="s6.13;p3.13">Risk of flood damage is particularly great in small settlements in semi-arid regions due to the rarity of extreme rainfall and in a warmer world the frequency of these storms would increase. </s><s n="s7.13;p3.13">During extreme rainfall, houses, roads, irrigation systems, and other constructions are destroyed and human settlements in oases are isolated because telecommunication and traffic connections are broken. </s><s n="s8.13;p3.13">As settlements have become adapted to the dry conditions, the total numbers of deaths and the total amount of damages caused by drought and other impacts of dry conditions often are smaller than those caused by heavy rainfall. </s><s n="s9.13;p3.13">Damages to the water supply caused by flooding can be disastrous; it can damage water treatment works, flood wells, septic tanks and waste disposal areas and sometimes overwhelm treatment systems, contaminating water supplies. </s><s n="s10.13;p3.13">In the case of drought, reduced water availability could force people to use polluted water sources in settlements at the same time that reduced flow rates reduce the rate of dilution of water contaminants. </s><s n="s11.13;p3.13">The quality of the water supply can also be affected with the growth of algae and other plants being much more prolific in higher temperatures, leaving behind nutrients when they decompose. </s><s n="s12.13;p3.13">These changes and unpredictability of the rains will impact on the welfare of the people with increased hunger, tiredness and sickness. </s><s n="s13.13;p3.13">Massive impacts will also be felt on natural resource based livelihoods, which are very common, generally in terms of crops dying, less feed for animals, less or poorer quality grass which all compound to have financial implications. </s></p><note place="end" id="BAWE_0363b-endnote.001"><p n="pn1.1"><s
