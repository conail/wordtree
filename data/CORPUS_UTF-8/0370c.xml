type="section"><p n="p1.8"><s n="s1.8;p1.8">The experience of democratization is a process that varies according to the country in question. </s><s n="s2.8;p1.8">In development literature, some see democracy as a means to an end and some as an inevitable consequence. </s><s n="s3.8;p1.8">Also opposing views exist and it has been argued that to achieve drastic growth a country benefits most from an authoritative regime like in Stalin's Russia or China. </s><s n="s4.8;p1.8">The article by Acemoglu and Robinson, <hi rend="italic">Democratization or Repression?</hi> </s><s n="s5.8;p1.8">(July 1999, MIT working paper) proposes a theoretical model on the likelihood of elite to become repressive and under what conditions a revolution of the masses is likely. </s><s n="s6.8;p1.8">The structure of this review is to shortly explain the intuition behind Acemoglu and Robinson's model, and to summarise the main conclusions. </s><s n="s7.8;p1.8">Then, the implications of the results and their empirical applicability will be commented on. </s><s n="s8.8;p1.8">It will be shown that even though the theoretical model is well arranged and clearly set out, the restrictive assumptions behind it act as a major factor undermining the ability of the model to explain historical democratization experiences and to predict the outcomes of current ones. </s></p><p n="p2.8"><s n="s1.7;p2.8">The model presented in the article is a game of incomplete information between three agents: the rich, the middle class and the poor. </s><s n="s2.7;p2.8">The rich is the elite in power and it can be either tough, flexible or weak. </s><s n="s3.7;p2.8">The type of the elite is not observable to the public. </s><s n="s4.7;p2.8">The situation is social unrest caused by the disenfranchised poor where there exists a threat of a possible revolution. </s><s n="s5.7;p2.8">The elite have alternatives to institute a full scale democracy, to offer a limited franchise for the middle class or to repress the threat. </s><s n="s6.7;p2.8">The poor decide whether or not to attempt a revolution, which is costly, but if succeeds, will have them better off. </s><s n="s7.7;p2.8">Each of the three types of the elite generates a different median voter (poor, middle class or none) and therefore a different desired level of taxation and hence, redistribution. </s></p><p n="p3.8"><s n="s1.10;p3.8">The game is solved for a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium. </s><s n="s2.10;p3.8">In a game of complete information the solution has the three different types of elite choosing three different strategies and the poor never attempt a revolution. </s><s n="s3.10;p3.8">In contrast, the incomplete information case has two equilibria: a mixed strategy one where the elite play their strategies with different probabilities and a pure strategy equilibrium. </s><s n="s4.10;p3.8">It is a dominant strategy for the tough type to repress but the weak type never will. </s><s n="s5.10;p3.8">In the mixed strategy equilibrium the weak type pretends some of the time to be the flexible type, choosing limited enfranchisement. </s><s n="s6.10;p3.8">In the second equilibrium the flexible type does not choose the limited option, reason being that the poor interpret a concession as a sign of weakness. </s><s n="s7.10;p3.8">Also revolutions are made possible through incomplete information. </s><s n="s8.10;p3.8">Another interesting observation is that higher inequality in income increases the level of tax preferred by the poor and therefore makes democracy more costly. </s><s n="s9.10;p3.8">It follows from the model that this economy will more likely suffer repression and the probability of a revolution attempt is higher. </s><s n="s10.10;p3.8">Also an increase in the tax level preferred by the middle class has a similar effect. </s></p><p n="p4.8"><s n="s1.4;p4.8">The emergence of democratic institutions in the western countries during the 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> or early 20 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> centuries, followed by an extension of the franchise, has been credited to different factors. </s><s n="s2.4;p4.8">The reasons for elites to extend the franchise include the enlightenment (philosophical), political party competition or middle class drive (internal conflict), or a threat of revolution (external conflict). </s><s n="s3.4;p4.8">When the model in the paper is compared with these, it seems mostly applicable with the idea of an external conflict. </s><s n="s4.4;p4.8">However, the elite will not extend the franchise unless there is a threat, and according to Acemoglu and Robinson there is a threat of a revolution only when limited concessions are made, acting as a sign of weakness and when the cost of revolution is below the achievable benefits. </s></p><p n="p5.8"><s n="s1.2;p5.8">At first glance the model presented in the paper is very intuitive and seems to generate many interesting applications. </s><s n="s2.2;p5.8">However, when we start thinking of these applications, it becomes clear that the experience of democratization does not fit into one single pattern but has emerged in many countries under very difficult circumstances, for example the proclaimed increase in redistribution was not observed in the UK.<ref target="BAWE_0370c-ftnote.001"/> It is also not evident how this model could be used in helping the developing countries today to achieve a more stable political environment. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0370c-ftnote.001"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.2;pn1.1">Lindert, P.(1989) "Modern Fiscal Redistribution: A
