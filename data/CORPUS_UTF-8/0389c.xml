microwave energy is introduced into the sample remotely, there is no direct contact between the energy source and the sample. </s><s n="s7.8;p4.6">Microwave dielectric heating resembles a flash heating process where the energy is produced much more rapidly and the sample cools more rapidly at the end of the reaction. </s><s n="s8.8;p4.6">This leads to very different temperature-time profiles
