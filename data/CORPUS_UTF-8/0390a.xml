definition of this further measure, and any used to answer that question. </s><s n="s8.12;p2.17">Kant's solution is to resort to the aesthetic method: we measure an object in comparison to some other constituent of experience. </s><s n="s9.12;p2.17">I measure the pyramids in terms of their building blocks, for example, or I measure my sister in comparison to my brother. </s><s n="s10.12;p2.17">We

critique, where the ideas of reason lead us into error. </s><s n="s2.5;p16.17">As in the case of those antinomies however, the key to the arguments for the valuation Kant gives to the experience of the sublime is to be found in his system of transcendental idealism. </s><s n="s3.5;p16.17">Independently he will argue that the distinction between noumenon and phenomenon when thought through shows the reasonableness of supposing freedom to be sourced from outside of empirical causality. </s><s n="s4.5;p16.17">Independently Kant will argue for morality as sourced from reason. </s><s n="s5.5;p16.17">The arguments of the analytic of the sublime can therefore only fully be completed and the conclusion of the superiority of reason justified in the light of further work by Kant outside the analytic. </s></p><p n="p17.17"><s n="s1.6;p17.17">However, I think that Kant is committed to claiming more. </s><s n="s2.6;p17.17">He believes that the experience of the sublime is universal and necessary to all those subjects who have been educated to recognise their moral natures. </s><s n="s3.6;p17.17">Hence Kant wishes to claim that the feeling itself reveals reason's superiority: just as the pleasure felt in the experience of the beautiful is necessarily communicable and hence indicative of a universally shared propensity of the faculties, so must the pleasure felt in the sublime be. </s><s n="s4.6;p17.17">The difference is of course that only those with a sufficient moral education will experience the awesome extent or power of nature as sublime and as consequently showing the superiority of their rational natures. </s><s n="s5.6;p17.17">The nature and quality of the feeling itself - the feeling of the superiority of our rational natures - is its own deduction. </s><s n="s6.6;p17.17">Hence one who does not recognise this feeling or does not ascribe it the significance Kant does must fall back on one of two options: either accept the above claim that the justification of the claim of the superiority of reason lies outside the analytic; or conclude their moral education was poor. </s></p></div1></body><back><div1
