historical institutionalist approach, enables the identification of a kind of 'institutional culture', inherent within the institutions of the E.U. This culture may be observed in the informal voting practices and consensus building which occurs in the policy process. </s><s n="s3.4;p24.25">According to Maley and Richardson, (1996) this 'culture' provides some stability to what they describe as "such a fluid system". </s><s n="s4.4;p24.25">(Cited in Bulmer, 1998:376) </s></p><p n="p25.25"><s n="s1.9;p25.25">The context provided by a Historical Institutionalist approach to institutional analysis, allows us to go beyond the detailed configurative studies of the E.U. institutions that already exist and place them in a context which allows differentiation between formal political institutions, informal conventions and the norms and beliefs embedded within those institutions". </s><s n="s2.9;p25.25">(Bulmer, 1994:353) It is argued, that this approach may also help understanding of the transformation of E.U Governance brought about by the Single European Act and subsequently by the Treaty on European Union. </s><s n="s3.9;p25.25">Therefore Historical Institutionalism can be used as an analytical tool in which to help increase understanding of the major changes brought about by the SEA and the TEU. The implementation of these changes brought about "changes in institutional and inter-institutional behaviour; they brought about changes in conventions and above all, the norms embedded in the institutions." </s><s n="s4.9;p25.25">(Bulmer, 1994:370) It is clear, from the New Institutionalist ideas proposed in this essay, that political actors are clearly driven by institutional duties and roles as well as, or instead of, by calculated self interest. </s><s n="s5.9;p25.25">Furthermore, the analysis tells us that politics is organized around the "construction and interpretation of meaning, as well as, or instead of the making of choices; routines, rules and forms evolve through history-dependent processes that do not reliably and quickly reach unique equilibria". </s><s n="s6.9;p25.25">Therefore, the institutions of politics are not just "simple echoes of social forces; and the polity is something different from, or more than an arena for competition among interest." </s><s n="s7.9;p25.25">(March and Olsen, 1984. </s><s n="s8.9;p25.25">Cited in Bulmer, 1998:375) Essentially, "Institutions play a central role in structuring the governance of the E.U" and therefore, it is clear that "institutional analysis is thus the central element of an E.U toolkit." </s><s n="s9.9;p25.25">(Bulmer, 1994:378) </s></p></div1></body><back><div1 type="bibliography"><head rend="underlined bold">Bibliography</head><div2 type="bibliography"><head rend="underlined">Books</head><p>Eilstrup-Sangiovanni, M.
