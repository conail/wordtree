It calls for a constant supply of fuel, and as a result of doing work, it suffers wear and tear. The body must burn fuel in order that the heat it is always giving off may be continuously replaced; and it must burn still more fuel whenever it does work. From this necessity there is no escape...it is, of course the food eaten which provides these fundamental needs of the body; and if we are to understand properly the nutrition of mankind, we must bear in mind the two distinct functions of food- its function as fuel and its function of a repair material.'
