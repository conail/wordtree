Thus, protection for battered women depends as much on social movements for structural changes and social justice as it does on culturally competent services for individual women and communities.<ref target="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.027"/> </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0404c-ftnote.027"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Natalie J.
