n="s2.5;p1.59">The most common symptom is breathing difficulties, caused by the body's susceptibility to common lung infections. </s><s n="s3.5;p1.59">Over the course of time successive lung infections cause significant lung damage, leaving the lungs struggling to function and making breathing difficult [1]. </s><s n="s4.5;p1.59">Cystic fibrosis sufferers are particularly susceptible to pneumonia. </s><s n="s5.5;p1.59">There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, although the effects of lung infections can be reduced by a course of antibiotics early in the course of the infection. </s></p><p n="p2.59"><s n="s1.4;p2.59">The pancreas is similarly affected by cystic fibrosis, failing to produce digestive enzymes which makes it difficult for cystic fibrosis patients to absorb nutrients [1]. </s><s n="s2.4;p2.59">This means that cystic fibrosis sufferers often suffer from malnutrition, resulting in them growing in height at a lower rate than normal and consequently they have often have lower heights than would be predicted. </s><s n="s3.4;p2.59">The difficulty absorbing nutrients also leads to generally low weights when compared with the rest of the population [2]. </s><s n="s4.4;p2.59">Cystic fibrosis also causes liver problems and infertility, but this report will mostly be concerned with examining the malnutrition and lung damage of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. </s></p><p n="p3.59"><s n="s1.1;p3.59">This report ultimately aims to explore the relationship between the strength of the respiratory muscles in cystic fibrosis patients and their level of malnutrition and lung damage, producing a good model for a patient's maximal static expiratory pressure (a measure of the strength of the respiratory muscles) with respect to their lung volume and other variables. </s></p><p n="p4.59"><s n="s1.1;p4.59">The cystic fibrosis data is a collection of measurements of age, sex, height, weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), body mass as a percentage of the age-specific median in normal individuals (BMP), forced expiratory volume (1 second) as a percentage of forced vital capacity (FEV1), residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC), total lung capacity (TLC) and maximal static expiratory pressure (PEmax) from 25 individuals with cystic fibrosis aged between 7 and 23. </s></p><p n="p5.59"><s n="s1.7;p5.59">The data set is a multivariate data set, with the variables height, weight, BMI and BMP all indicative in some manner of the general level of a patient's malnutrition and the variables FEV1, RV, FRC and TLC all measuring various aspects of a patient's lung volume. </s><s n="s2.7;p5.59">RV, residual volume, represents the amount of air remaining in the lungs following a maximal expiration of air from the lungs (all the air that remains after you have fully breathed out). </s><s n="s3.7;p5.59">FRC, functional residual capacity, is the amount of air remaining in the lungs following a normal breath. </s><s n="s4.7;p5.59">TLC, total lung capacity, is the total volume of the lungs following a maximal respiration. </s><s n="s5.7;p5.59">These are complicated to measure and involve the patient being placed in an air-tight chamber, or nitrogen washout of the lungs. </s><s n="s6.7;p5.59">They also require the cooperation of the patient to get a reliable measurement and are often under measured. </s><s n="s7.7;p5.59">FEV1, the forced expiratory volume as a percentage of Forced Vital Capacity, can be taken using a spirometer and is slightly less dependent on patient cooperation than the other measurements. </s></p><p n="p6.59"><s n="s1.5;p6.59">The most promising general form of model to fit to the data seems to be a multiple linear regression model using PEmax as the dependent variable. </s><s n="s2.5;p6.59">However, given the number of variables involved in the data set, careful analysis will be required to determine the variables chosen to use in the regression. </s><s n="s3.5;p6.59">An important aspect of the initial analysis will be data reduction and summary to examine relationships between the variables. </s><s n="s4.5;p6.59">Due to the number of variables measuring the same underlying features (and therefore expecting to have high correlations with each other) multicollinearity will likely be a consideration in the regression. </s><s n="s5.5;p6.59">The data will also need to be analysed to determine if any anomalous results or outliers are present. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined bold">Summary of the Data</head><p

suggesting that there is a fairly even male-female spread in the population. </s><s n="s2.5;p8.59">The table gives a fairly good indication of the location, range and general spread of the data. </s><s n="s3.5;p8.59">Weight, age and RV in particular seem to have a large amount of variation. </s><s n="s4.5;p8.59">In particular, none of the subjects have a BMP over 100 so all of the subjects are below the average body mass index for their age. </s><s n="s5.5;p8.59">This is a fairly good indication that most of them are suffering from malnutrition. </s></p><p n="p9.59"><s n="s1.1;p9.59">There do not seem to be any cases of extreme outliers within the variables - all the minimum and maximum values are within three standard deviations of the mean, and the table below demonstrates that all the points fall within the inner fences (at 1.5 times the interquartile range) of the data. </s></p><table id="BAWE_0406e-tab.002"><head rend="underlined bold">Table 2 -

appear to be caused by anything other than normal variation in the data. </s><s n="s2.2;p10.59">The values of subjects 15 and 25 for PEmax come close to being considered mild outliers and warrant further consideration, but there are no values which need to be eliminated immediately or investigated because they appear to be caused by experimental error. </s></p><p n="p11.59"><s n="s1.4;p11.59">The table of quartiles also gives some indication of the spread of the data within variables that the simple summary statistics did not highlight. </s><s n="s2.4;p11.59">Many of the variables appear to be quite heavily positively skewed. </s><s n="s3.4;p11.59">BMP, RV and PEmax all have median values that are far closer to the value of the lower quartile than the upper quartile, indicating skewness of the data. </s><s n="s4.4;p11.59">This is further emphasised by examining the distribution of PEmax. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_0406e-fig.001"><head rend="underlined bold">Graph 1 - Histogram of PEmax</head></figure><p n="p12.59"><s n="s1.4;p12.59">The above histogram gives an indication of the distribution of PEmax. </s><s n="s2.4;p12.59">It appears as though PEmax is roughly normally distributed but highly positively skewed, with a heavy right tail. </s><s n="s3.4;p12.59">The extreme values could be considered outliers but the number of them suggests they are not. </s><s n="s4.4;p12.59">With a relatively small sample size it is difficult to determine whether a variable is actually normally distributed but the histogram seems to indicate that PEmax has some significant deviations from the normal and a normal probability plot of PEmax backs this up. </s></p><p n="p13.59"><s n="s1.3;p13.59">An idea of the relationships between the different variables and how strongly

these have been measured to get an idea of the underlying level of malnutrition in the patients it is unsurprising that the correlation between these variables is strong. </s><s n="s3.7;p14.59">Age has little correlation with BMP since BMP takes into account the average body mass index of a patient's age, thus removing age as a factor in BMI. Sex has very little correlation with any of the other variables, indicating that there may be no real difference between the male and female patients examined. </s><s n="s4.7;p14.59">The correlations of the lung volume variables are surprising. </s><s n="s5.7;p14.59">While you would expect larger lung volumes to translate into better lung strength, three of the lung volume variables seem to have a weak negative relationship with a patient's maximal static expiratory pressure. </s><s n="s6.7;p14.59">Additionally, FEV1 seems to have produced significantly different results to the other three measures of lung volume, showing weak negative correlation with the other variables. </s><s n="s7.7;p14.59">This is likely to be due to the difference between how FEV1 and RV/FRC/TLC are measured. </s></p><p n="p15.59"><s n="s1.2;p15.59">The strongest relationship of any variable with PEmax is with age. </s><s n="s2.2;p15.59">The graph below shows a plot of age against PEmax. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_0406e-fig.002"><head rend="underlined bold">Graph 2 - Age vs. PEmax</head></figure><p n="p16.59"><s n="s1.3;p16.59">The relationship between age and PEmax appears to be quite strong and reasonably linear. </s><s n="s2.3;p16.59">Older subjects clearly have higher values of PEmax in general, although there are two outliers that suggest that the relationship might not be perfectly linear. </s><s n="s3.3;p16.59">Height and weight have similar relationships with PEmax. </s></p><p n="p17.59"><s n="s1.3;p17.59">The graph below gives some indication of the relationship between the lung volumes of the subjects and their maximal static expiratory pressure (PEmax). </s><s n="s2.3;p17.59">The graph has ordered the subjects in ascending order based on their PEmax value, with 1 representing the subject with the lowest value of PEmax and 25 the subject with the highest value of PEmax. </s><s n="s3.3;p17.59">The circle shows the residual lung volume (RV) of the patient, the triangle their functional residual lung volume (FRC) and the cross their total lung volume (TLC). </s></p><figure id="BAWE_0406e-fig.003"><head rend="underlined bold">Graph 3 - Plot of Subjects' Lung Volumes</head></figure><p n="p18.59"><s n="s1.4;p18.59">The graph demonstrates some interesting features of the relationship between the various lung volume variables. </s><s n="s2.4;p18.59">Firstly, for all patients, RV is the highest of all volumes and in most cases the difference between RV and the other two variables is dramatic. </s><s n="s3.4;p18.59">On the whole, FRC is also greater than TLC, although there are a few cases where TLC is above FRC (note than in these cases the difference between the two is extremely small). </s><s n="s4.4;p18.59">In general, this is enough to conclude that RV is greater than FRC and FRC is greater than TLC.
