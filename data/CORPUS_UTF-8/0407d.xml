Schopenhauer glorifies the moral significance of life whilst life for Nietzsche has no intrinsic moral meaning, Schopenhauer's greatest aspiration is to deny the will whilst Nietzsche only affirms it, for Schopenhauer suffering devalues life and yet for Nietzsche suffering inspires creativity, strength and self-overcoming. </s><s n="s2.5;p1.13">This idea of suffering, and its counterpart; compassion, form a pivotal point of departure between these two writers. </s><s n="s3.5;p1.13">Compassion, for Nietzsche, was an important topic because "the problem of the value of pity conjures up doubt, mistrust, fear, and the belief in all morality wavers." </s><s n="s4.5;p1.13">(GMp6), however it was, for Schopenhauer, the basis of morality; a basis which Nietzsche viewed as grossly misguided. </s><s n="s5.5;p1.13">This essay will form a study on the merits and demerits of Nietzsche's criticisms of compassion and subsequently his criticisms of Schopenhauer. </s></p><p n="p2.13"><s n="s1.10;p2.13">It would conform to tradition to clarify here what I intend by the word compassion, as used in the title. </s><s n="s2.10;p2.13">Although perhaps not strictly necessary and a little tedious, we are examining, in English, a German word whose meaning may have warped through translation, and so this discussion should satisfy the discerning reader. </s><s n="s3.10;p2.13">Both Nietzsche and Schopenhauer use the word 'mitleid', and in Schopenhauer it is accepted that what he means is a direct translation to 'compassion', or more accurately 'suffering with'. </s><s n="s4.10;p2.13">Readers of Nietzsche have disagreed as to whether Nietzsche is using <hi rend="italic">Mitleid</hi> in the sense of compassion or pity. </s><s n="s5.10;p2.13">The difference is thought to be significant because whilst compassion is commonly heralded as benevolent and selfless, pity can sometimes also be interpreted as 'looking down upon'. </s><s n="s6.10;p2.13">If Nietzsche is condemning pity in this sense his position is more understandable and less startling than if he were condemning pure compassion, and it will become obvious that Nietzsche see's <hi rend="italic">mitleid</hi> as a way of possibly gaining power over the sufferer. </s><s n="s7.10;p2.13">The German word '<hi rend="italic">Mitleid</hi>', however, translates equally into English as both compassion and pity. </s><s n="s8.10;p2.13">The English word 'compassion', according to the Oxford Dictionary of English<ref target="BAWE_0407d-ftnote.002"/>, means 'sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others', and pity is 'feelings of sorrow and compassion caused by sufferings or misfortunes of others'. </s><s n="s9.10;p2.13">General semantic acceptance then seems to view these words as pretty much interchangeable; 'pity' as a 'looking down upon' seems to have entered general meaning through misuse or misinterpretation. </s><s n="s10.10;p2.13">Regardless of these definitions, what is clear is that whatever Nietzsche is addressing, he (rightly or wrongly) takes to be the same condition as the one Schopenhauer is addressing, and his discussions of mitleid are almost direct responses to him.<ref target="BAWE_0407d-ftnote.003"/> This essay will therefore use the terms pity and compassion interchangeably and the quotes I use will remain faithful to the particular translations I am quoting from. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0407d-ftnote.002"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1"><hi rend="italic">Oxford Dictionary of English,</hi> OUP, 2005 (2nd Ed.) </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0407d-ftnote.003"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.2;pn1.1">Nussbaum claims that a total of seven different words feature in Nietzsche's thinking on the subject - eleos, oikos (Greek), misericordia (Latin), pitie (French), mitleid (German), pity/ compassion (English). </s><s n="s2.2;pn1.1">She suggests that thus for Nietzsche all of these words are related. </s></p></note><p n="p3.13"><s n="s1.15;p3.13"><hi rend="italic">On The Basis Of Morality</hi> contains Schopenhauer's most illusive exposition of compassion. </s><s n="s2.15;p3.13">He explains that we cannot examine the motives of actions in terms of empirical evidence because we can only <hi rend="italic">observe</hi> the action, not the motive behind it;

"Philosophers one and all...wanted to furnish the rational ground of morality" and that "Schopenhauer too failed to do it". </s><s n="s4.8;p6.13">In the Anti-Christ also, Nietzsche claims; "Schopenhauer was hostile to life: therefore pity became for him a virtue". </s><s n="s5.8;p6.13">Nietzsche thinks that Schopenhauer is misconstruing compassion, he lacks a psychological understanding of it because he lacks experience of it; "those who glorify pity lack experience of it in the realm of morality" (D133). </s><s n="s6.8;p6.13">He is adamant that "'There is no moral yardstick" (D139) and that Schopenhauer is being led by his heart and not his reason. </s><s n="s7.8;p6.13">In the Gay Science (99), Nietzsche accuses Schopenhauer of "mystical embarrassments and subterfuges" due to his fascination with Eastern philosophies, and in the same aphorism claims that Schopenhauer's theory is "nonsense about pity, about how it breaks through the principle of individuation and how it is the source of all morality". </s><s n="s8.8;p6.13">For Nietzsche compassion is remarkable, but not because it is a 'boundary mark of metaphysics'; compassion should be discouraged since it only brings forth more suffering in the world, a central argument that will be supported later in the essay. </s></p><p n="p7.13"><s n="s1.13;p7.13">Nietzsche's writing forms the antithesis of Schopenhauer's compassion. </s><s n="s2.13;p7.13">In <hi rend="italic">Daybreak</hi> (esp. </s><s n="s3.13;p7.13">133) Nietzsche's explanation of why we might leap into the water after someone is far from altruistic. </s><s n="s4.13;p7.13">The thoughtless person, he says, puts it down to pity. </s><s n="s5.13;p7.13">Nietzsche elucidates that granted, few people would admit to consciously thinking of themselves at such a time, however we have a very strong <hi rend="italic">unconscious</hi> egoistic motivation. </s><s n="s6.13;p7.13">He goes so far as to say that another's hardship offends us to the point that we would feel shame and cowardice if we did not help. </s><s n="s7.13;p7.13">Our reaction to this offence is to feel compassion out of self-defence or even revenge. </s><s n="s8.13;p7.13">Power and overcoming others is a significant feature in Nietzsche, and we play the part of the more powerful helper because we expect applause and recognition, and we choose to play an active part in dramas of suffering perhaps to alleviate our boredom. </s><s n="s9.13;p7.13">Pure pleasure can also arise in such situations when we contrast the sufferer's position to our own. </s><s n="s10.13;p7.13">The thought that we can help if only we choose to and the expectance of praise and homage also make pity pleasurable and therefore pity has many constituents. </s><s n="s11.13;p7.13">"Even if we offer ourselves as martyrs do for their church this is a sacrifice that is offered for our desire for power," (GS13) therefore an action from compassion never lacks a reason<ref target="BAWE_0407d-ftnote.006"/>, and this reason is much less mystical than Schopenhauer's unification principle. </s><s n="s12.13;p7.13">One criticism of Schopenhauer's theory is that the compassionate person seems to lack agency, acting always for the will. </s><s n="s13.13;p7.13">It may seem more realistic and even optimistic to hold that the person acts compassionately because they are acting autonomously and with agency, and because it will benefit them in some way. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0407d-ftnote.006"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Egoism clearly gives us a better explanation for our actions than altruism, since if we are not motivated by our own good our actions seem almost random;

"Pity stands in antithesis to the tonic emotions which enhance the energy of the feeling of life: it has a depressive effect" and "The loss of force which life has already sustained through suffering is increased and multiplied even further by pity". </s><s n="s3.9;p8.13">This is in direct contrast to Schopenhauer, who, "has made it [pity] <hi rend="italic">the</hi> virtue" (A7) and for whom no action could better demonstrate moral value. </s><s n="s4.9;p8.13">What Schopenhauer fails to acknowledge, however, and what Nietzsche see's as an important point is the role of the sufferer in conjunction with that of the compassionate person. </s><s n="s5.9;p8.13">He recognizes that there is something degrading in suffering and elevating in pitying. </s><s n="s6.9;p8.13">When we pity we are being unintentionally cruel; "when I helped him, then I sorely injured his pride" (D134). </s><s n="s7.9;p8.13">In the Gay Science (338) Nietzsche notes that the sufferer generally hides his suffering, since suffering is a sign of weakness; "All arousing of pity and calling for help is seductive, for our 'own way' is too hard." </s><s n="s8.9;p8.13">If others notice our suffering they tend to assume access to the deepest recesses of our heart, but in fact they evaluate us superficially. </s><s n="s9.9;p8.13">Pity therefore takes away what is personal to the sufferer. </s></p><p n="p9.13"><s n="s1.7;p9.13">The kindest way to be compassionate, if we must be compassionate, is from a distance; "I don't want to be recognized for being compassionate" (Z 'Of the Compassionate) he tells us, for the compassionate are too lacking in shame and the sufferer would be shamed by our compassion. </s><s n="s2.7;p9.13">This is in no way unkindness on Nietzsche's part; on the contrary it is a warning, a recommendation for a better world. </s><s n="s3.7;p9.13">Far from the 'boot-in-the-face' picture of Nietzsche presented by some<ref target="BAWE_0407d-ftnote.007"/>, in the Gay Science (338) he urges us; "to share not suffering but joy". </s><s n="s4.7;p9.13">Our time would be better spent leaning how to enjoy ourselves rather than learning how to be compassionate since it is better that we unlearn how to harm others. </s><s n="s5.7;p9.13">This draws out another detail not found Schopenhauer's theory; a differentiation between types of compassion, such as compassion for friends and compassion for strangers. </s><s n="s6.7;p9.13">Since Schopenhauer's principle of individuation renders all individuals identical in their suffering we are supposed to treat all men equally. </s><s n="s7.7;p9.13">That, in reality, is not the case. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0407d-ftnote.007"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Nussbaum, pg.... </s></p></note><p n="p10.13"><s n="s1.11;p10.13">"Can you go near to your friend without going over him?" </s><s n="s2.11;p10.13">Nietzsche asks in <hi rend="italic">Thus Spoke Zarathustra</hi> ('Of Friends'). </s><s n="s3.11;p10.13">Considering how humiliating compassion can be, it is hardly something we should endeavor to inflict upon our friends: "let your pity for your friend conceal itself under a hard shell" he advises us. </s><s n="s4.11;p10.13">It is all too easy for us to wish to relieve the pain of a friend, whilst underneath our supposed 'suffering with' him, we are really relishing their active gratitude and homage, indeed one may be familiar with the feeling of rejection often felt when a friend in need has refused our help, when really we should be admiring his independence and strength. </s><s n="s5.11;p10.13">"If you have a suffering friend, be a resting place for his suffering, but a resting place like a hard bed, a camp bed;
