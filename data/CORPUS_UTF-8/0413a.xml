I argue this in three stages. In the first stage I establish how feminist theory unravels the androcentric nature of the structure of international relations, despite the latter's claims to gender neutrality which the problem-solving theories of Realism and Neo-realism accept. This discovery of the true nature of the structure of international relations leads to a redefinition of the ontology of international relations. This marks the second stage of the argument. Here I illustrate the various changes made to the ontological space and examine how each change serves to rectify the male-bias in the field ; thereby allowing a more comprehensive understanding of international relations than that offered by the established theories. These redefinitions to the ontology of international relations necessitate a change in the epistemological approaches to the field too. In this stage of the argument I examine the concepts of "dynamic objectivity" and "empathetic cooperation", and establish that they constitute an extremely accurate methodology to the study of international relations. Finally, I conclude that feminist theory offers a better understanding to the study of international relations and the main reason or this is that it is a critical theory, unlike Realism and Neo-realism.</p></div1></front><body><div1 type="section"><quote lang="English">"[T]he structurality of structure--- although it has always been at work, has always been neutralised or reduced, and this by a process of giving it a center...
