thereby drawing these less developed areas into the structure of transnational capitalism, the implications of which I analyse in the second section of the argument. </s><s n="s3.4;p9.46">Capital mobility enables TNCs to bid for the lowest labour, social, and environmental costs, leading to a "downward levelling" of the minimum standards for the same (Brecher and Costello, 1994;

thereby resulting in not much profit for the subcontractors, though it yields great profits to the TNCs from cheap costs of production and from the "royalties and R&amp;D (research and development) costs" that these corporations incur (Tujan, 1997). </s></p><p n="p11.46"><s n="s1.8;p11.46">TNCs also maximise profits through "price manipulation". </s><s n="s2.8;p11.46">They determine the "CMT (cut, make and trim)" of the supplier as well as the latter's share in profit. </s><s n="s3.8;p11.46">On several occasions these prices are lower than even the costs of production. </s><s n="s4.8;p11.46">This unfair expropriation of surplus from the subcontractors eventually results in the exploitation of the workers. </s><s n="s5.8;p11.46">Also, workers are very often robbed of job security and do not even enjoy the benefits offered under "various schemes like agency hiring, short term contracts, and casual hiring as piece rate workers, trainees, apprentices" etc. </s><s n="s6.8;p11.46">Also, the risk of losing their jobs prevents them from forming unions and thus, from securing the " benefits mandated by law" or gained otherwise through collective bargaining". </s><s n="s7.8;p11.46">Even where unions continue to exist they are marginalised. </s><s n="s8.8;p11.46">The Philippine Long Distance Company , for instance, keeps its union in control by "replacing the majority of the work force with contractuals" (Tujan 1997). </s></p><p n="p12.46"><s n="s1.8;p12.46">The global policies of liberalisation and deregulation have also led to a global free trade market. </s><s n="s2.8;p12.46">Free traders advocate the removal of all barriers to trade on the principle of 'comparative advantage' that is supposed to benefit all. </s><s n="s3.8;p12.46">'Comparative advantage' implies that every country must specialize in those activities in which it is most productive, and then trade it to its own best advantage. </s><s n="s4.8;p12.46">However, this leads to unequal exchange between countries " 'selling capital-intensive (thus cheap) products for a high price and buying labour-intensive (thus expensive) products for a low price. </s><s n="s5.8;p12.46">This imbalance of trade expands the gap between rich and poor'" (Smith in Shah, 2005). </s><s n="s6.8;p12.46">Brecher and Costello argue, that with the increased power and reach of the TNCs the implications of "comparative advantage" have worsened still. </s><s n="s7.8;p12.46">They say that though "General Motors or Toyota can set up the same car factory with virtually the same productivity in the United States, Mexico, or China [...] 'comparative advantage' leads production to move where " the advantages of "cheap labour, poor environmental protection, and low social costs" are more readily available (Brecher and Costello 1994; pp.68-9). </s><s n="s8.8;p12.46">Free trade based on such "comparative advantage", then, does not lead to benefits for all but to profits for the TNCs alone. </s></p><p n="p13.46"><s n="s1.3;p13.46">Thus, one sees how the TNCs pull disadvantaged economies into the exploitative structure of transnational capitalism, to maximise their own profits at the cost of the latter's growing dependency and underdevelopment. </s><s n="s2.3;p13.46">However, the TNCs do not achieve this end all by themselves. </s><s n="s3.3;p13.46">Instead they are enabled and supported by international institutions like the IMF, World Bank and WTO, that also constitute the core of the TCS. These institutions of global governance help by regulating the dynamics of globalisation to create a global environment conducive to the strengthening of the TCS. However, in the discussion below I have restricted myself to illustrations that sufficiently elucidate my argument. </s></p><p n="p14.46"><s n="s1.4;p14.46">As discussed above, TNCs get their bargaining power from the presence of a huge number of weak economies. </s><s n="s2.4;p14.46">Most of these countries suffer from a major debt crisis which has been further accentuated by the Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) dictated by the IMF and World Bank (Shah, 2005; Tujan 1997). </s><s n="s3.4;p14.46">The SAPs have been succeeded by the more 'democratically' formulated Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. </s><s n="s4.4;p14.46">However, since the SAPs have been in the picture for longer than the latter, examining the former's impact might be more beneficial. </s></p><p n="p15.46"><s n="s1.2;p15.46">Some of the general conditions imposed by the SAPs on debtor countries are as follows: reduced government spending to reduce demand for capital inflows from abroad; liberalisation of imports to enhance the efficiency of local industries; export-oriented production for earning the much-needed foreign exchange; privatisation of state enterprises (Brecher and Costello 1994, pp.56-7; Shah 2005). </s><s n="s2.2;p15.46">Each of these conditions enhances the bargaining power of the TNCs by rendering the poor more vulnerable and dependent than before. </s></p><p n="p16.46"><s n="s1.6;p16.46">Reduction in government expenditure, for instance, has the foremost impact on funds spent on health care, education and other welfare activities. </s><s n="s2.6;p16.46">Reduced government expenditure on education ensures that the future citizens of the country shall remain jobless, or shall have to suffice with low-paid jobs; this leads to increasing desperation and dependence on whatever the TNCs and IFIs have to offer. </s><s n="s3.6;p16.46">Reduction in health care expenditure has even more devastating impacts. </s><s n="s4.6;p16.46">According to Ann- Louise Colgan , a research associate with Africa Action , "cutbacks in health budgets and privatization of health" have eroded advances that these countries had made before their governments ceded the power of economic decision-making to the IMF and World Bank, in order to qualify for their loans in the 1980s and 1990s (Colgan, 2002). </s><s n="s5.6;p16.46">This has resulted in the spread of AIDS and in the reduction of life expectancy by about fifteen years; thereby rendering a large part of the population unfit for labour-intensive work, which is what most of the population is compelled to do due to lack of education. </s><s n="s6.6;p16.46">Thus, the vicious circle reproduces itself, aggravating the problem of underdevelopment and dependency in these regions, which the TNCs exploit to make profits. </s></p><p n="p17.46"><s n="s1.3;p17.46">The SAPs also force countries into export-oriented production. </s><s n="s2.3;p17.46">However, according to the World Bank about fifty developing countries rely on three or fewer commodities for more than half of their export earnings, while about twenty of those countries rely on the export of commodities for ninety percent of their total foreign exchange earnings (Laidlaw, 2001). </s><s n="s3.3;p17.46">It is this production of commodities that prevents export-oriented production from yielding benefits to the respective countries, since commodities are cheaper than the expensive products imported by these countries for their survival; thereby leading to trade deficits and consequently, to dependency. </s></p><p n="p18.46"><s n="s1.1;p18.46">Thus, the very purpose for implementing SAPs in underdeveloped and developing countries gets undermined , for these programmes cause the reproduction of underdevelopment and dependency rather than leading to much improvement in the condition of these countries; thereby, creating fertile ground for the expansion and strengthening of TNCs. </s></p><p n="p19.46"><s n="s1.6;p19.46">However, while the IMF and World Bank help the TNCs in an indirect way, by creating conditions conducive to their growth , the WTO advocates the interests of the TCS, more directly. </s><s n="s2.6;p19.46">The WTO (like the TNCs) is based on the free-market ideology and is more powerful than the GATT , for it has " a legal and institutional foundation, backed by a dispute settlement system. </s><s n="s3.6;p19.46">Countries which do not abide by the trade rules are taken to court and can eventually face retaliation" (Kwa, 1999). </s><s n="s4.6;p19.46">"One notorious example of how the WTO upholds corporate power is the TRIPS agreement, which corporations are using to deny poor countries access to low-cost generic versions of patented medicines." </s><s n="s5.6;p19.46">For instance, India produces generic versions of AIDS drugs which South Africa imports for a fraction of the price it would pay for the patented drugs. </s><s n="s6.6;p19.46">But this has created an uproar in the US pharmaceutical industry which has used the TRIPS agreement to challenge this practice (Yu, 2005). </s></p><p n="p20.46"><s n="s1.3;p20.46">The global services sector provides another fertile ground for the TNCs to earn massive profits. </s><s n="s2.3;p20.46">"In 2004, the value of global exports of commercial services [monopolized by the TNCs] reached $2.1 trillion, a 16% increase from the previous year." </s><s n="s3.3;p20.46">This led the US and EU to aim at using the GATS agreement to further open up the services sector of Third World countries, for earning greater profits (Yu, 2005). </s></p><p n="p21.46"><s n="s1.3;p21.46">Therefore, it is established that international institutions like the IMF, World Bank and the WTO, do use their power for global governance to enable and better the functioning of TNCs, which are central to the system of transnational capitalism. </s><s n="s2.3;p21.46">However, the contribution of national actors, to this transnational system, cannot be ignored. </s><s n="s3.3;p21.46">In fact it is precisely this connection between the national government, TNCs and international institutions, that the previous example alludes to. </s></p><p n="p22.46"><s n="s1.6;p22.46">Since the TNCs are transnational institutions, they may or may not have one home country (since mergers and acquisitions are characteristic of this phase of capitalism). </s><s n="s2.6;p22.46">Yet, they rely on all the government(s) that have a stake in the former's development, for the furthering of their ambitions. </s><s n="s3.6;p22.46">Countries with the maximum stakes are usually the First World countries, that also have the greatest sway in the decision-making processes of international institutions. </s><s n="s4.6;p22.46">This makes alliances with these national governments highly essential to these transnational corporations. </s><s n="s5.6;p22.46">Governments of these countries (though not all people necessarily) also benefit from alliances with their TNCs, as is evident from the example on GATS, mentioned above. </s><s n="s6.6;p22.46">Thus the governments of rich nations and the TNCs enjoy a relationship of mutual benefits; each exploiting the opportunities provided by globalisation (and international institutions of global governance) to ensure the growth and stability of the TCS. </s></p><p n="p23.46"><s n="s1.2;p23.46">Other national institutions, like educational institutions also support the TCS by producing staff members for all the above-mentioned institutions that constitute the core of the TCS (Sunkel and Fuenzalida, 1979; p.72). </s><s n="s2.2;p23.46">For instance, in his critique of the americanisation of the World Bank, Robert Wade points out that most economists at the bank, irrespective of their nationality and other qualifications, possess a postgraduate degree from a North American university; thereby implying the crucial role educational institutions play, in the process of ideological reproduction, which is much-needed for promoting and justifying the existence of the TCS (Wade 2001; p.14). "[M]agazines, newspapers of worldwide circulation, news agencies, multinational advertising companies and television networks", also share with these educational institutions "the task of elaborating and diffusing the vision of the world that promotes the interests of the TNCs" (Sunkel and Fuenzalida, 1979; p.72). </s></p><p n="p24.46"><s n="s1.2;p24.46">The discussion till this point establishes the role the TCS' core performs in ensuring the stability and growth of the system, through the manipulation of institutions and global processes at the transnational, international and national levels. </s><s n="s2.2;p24.46">However, it is not just the dominant but also the dominated, that help to sustain the system that defines their subordinate status. </s></p><p n="p25.46"><s n="s1.4;p25.46">Here I am referring to what Sunkel and Fuenzalida call "transnational culture". </s><s n="s2.4;p25.46">They define it as the "cultural feature of the dynamics" of transnational capitalism that has led to "the creation of a homogenous market for consumption goods and services on a worldwide scale" (Sunkel and Fuenzalida,1979; p.73). </s><s n="s3.4;p25.46">Not only does it cover the dominant elites in the developing and underdeveloped countries (mentioned above as semi-periphery) but is also seen to impact the periphery (through the use of mass media, etc.), leading to their "partial adoption of these new consumption patterns[,] and [to] the distortion of the existing ones" (Sunkel and Fuenzalida, 1979; pp.73-4). </s><s n="s4.4;p25.46">The relevance of these patterns, with regard to the dependency argument, is obvious, and shall be elaborated upon in the next section of the essay. </s></p><p n="p26.46"><s n="s1.2;p26.46">The discussion carried out in this section thus establishes how the various components of the TCS enable the channeling of the dynamics of globalisation into the rapid growth of the core, and as an obvious corollary, into increasing the dependency and underdevelopment of the semi-periphery and periphery on the core. </s><s n="s2.2;p26.46">It is this channeling of the dynamics of globalisation by the TCS, into securing maximum profits for the core, even at the cost of increasing the dependency of the other two categories on the core, that makes globalisation a neo-colonial move rather than a set of free-flowing processes. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">The TCS--- A Dependency Analysis </head><p n="p27.46"><s n="s1.2;p27.46">It has been indicated in the previous section that dependency and underdevelopment of the semi-periphery and periphery of the TCS are essential to the latter's survival as well as to the definition of globalisation as a neo-colonial move. </s><s n="s2.2;p27.46">Thus, in this section I elucidate this necessary facet of TCS-regulated globalisation using the theories of dependency. </s></p><p n="p28.46"><s n="s1.3;p28.46">Central to a dependency analysis of the TCS is the structure of the system. </s><s n="s2.3;p28.46">As has been mentioned above, the TCS is divided into a core of TNCs and other national and international institutions that support it, a semi-periphery that includes the dominant classes of the developing and underdeveloped countries, and a periphery that includes the remaining people of the less advantaged world. </s><s n="s3.3;p28.46">Incorporation into this structure is itself the most crucial reason for the dependency of the semi-periphery<ref target="BAWE_0413c-ftnote.002"/> and periphery on the core (Frank 1971; p.34). </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0413c-ftnote.002"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.2;pn1.1">It is important to mention here that even though dependency theorists like Frank (neo-marxist) and Sunkel and Fuenzalida (structuralist), whom I specifically focus on in this paper, do not speak of a specific category called the semi-periphery, these dominant classes of the developing and underdeveloped world are discussed in their works too. </s><s n="s2.2;pn1.1">When Frank speaks of the major metropolises in the less developed world which are also satellites to the metropolises in developed countries (Frank 1969; pp. 30-35,341-3), and Sunkel and Fuenzalida single out the members of the "transnational community" who are based in the developed and underdeveloped countries (Sunkel and Fuenzalida 1979; p. 75), they are alluding to a stratum of people whom I have categorized as the semi-periphery of the TCS. </s></p></note><p n="p29.46"><s n="s1.4;p29.46">This incorporation is followed by the assignment of different tasks that constitute the production process, to the three strata of the TCS.
