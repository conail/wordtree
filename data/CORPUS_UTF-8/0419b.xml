Y la metafísica cubierta de amapolas? </quote><p n="p5.12"><s n="s1.10;p5.12">A literal description of flowers creates a warm image of colour and beauty that has been lost in divided Spain. </s><s n="s2.10;p5.12">Neruda returns to this image later on by describing 'la casa de las flores' where 'todas partes estallaban geranios' and tells that ruins of 'metal ardiendo' have now replaced these attractions. </s><s n="s3.10;p5.12">While the extinction of the abundance of 'lilas', 'amapolas' and 'geranios' from Neruda's words effectively conveys the bleak image of present Spain, Neruda also metaphorically alludes to the flowers of poetry. </s><s n="s4.10;p5.12">The poet suggests that he has sacrificed the use of intricate devices that decorate his poetry in favour of a more realistic bluntness in his words, which better conveys his thoughts to the people. </s><s n="s5.10;p5.12">When Neruda describes his house of the past, he doesn't idealise this object by comparing it to the present situation, but emphasises its normality. </s><s n="s6.10;p5.12">It was nothing more than a house among 'campanas', 'relojes' and 'árboles' in Madrid in an ordinary place and time. </s><s n="s7.10;p5.12">While there is a temptation to nostalgically elevate this house from the norm, Neruda prefers to emphasise that stable ordinariness must be appreciated as it will be missed when it is disturbed. </s><s n="s8.10;p5.12">Neruda continues his description of his house by expressing that one could see 'el rostro seco de Castilla' from his windows. </s><s n="s9.10;p5.12">While this could simply refer to the framework of Spain that meets its destruction in the Civil War, it is possible that Neruda alludes to a famous statue that symbolises the culture, traditions or history of Spain such as the statue of goddess, Cibele, or the great bullfighter, Antonio Bienvenida, that can be found in the capital city. </s><s n="s10.10;p5.12">Perhaps Neruda identifies these permanent historical exhibitions as a symbol of the severe impact this war will have on Spanish history, eternally staining the success of the country. </s></p><p n="p6.12"><s n="s1.10;p6.12">Neruda then moves from speaking of inanimate objects to live animals and humans whose beating heart and capacity for emotion better evoke the pity of the reader. </s><s n="s2.10;p6.12">He explains that his house was full of 'perros y chiquillos', inspiring the reader to feel pathos for these sensitive and emotive figures who may be lost to the sacrifices of the war. </s><s n="s3.10;p6.12">Later on in the poem, Neruda returns the children but, like feared, the children have been killed and only 'la sangre' remains. </s><s n="s4.10;p6.12">Neruda begins to construct a simile in these lines that he cannot finish: 'la sangre de los niños / corría simplemente, como sangre de los niños'. </s><s n="s5.10;p6.12">Neruda decides that there is no comparison for the slaying of children and the reality is enough to evoke a reaction from the reader. </s><s n="s6.10;p6.12">As the child provides the future of a nation, Neruda suggests Franco has sacrificed a hopeful future by insisting a fascist regime upon the people that they feel compelled to rebel against. </s><s n="s7.10;p6.12">Neruda then lists victims of the war including Federico Garcia Lorca who was assassinated. </s><s n="s8.10;p6.12">He refers to Raúl (González Tuñon), Rafael (Alberti) (Costa, <hi rend="italic">The poetry of Pablo Neruda</hi>, p. 95) and Federico with first names only and uses the non-polite pronoun, 'te', suggesting he knew them on a personal level and has suffered a personal loss in their exile or death, in the case of Lorca. </s><s n="s9.10;p6.12">In particular, his question to Lorca, 'te acuerdas' is tragically rhetorical as he will not be able to answer his friend 'debajo de la tierra'. </s><s n="s10.10;p6.12">His question to Lorca is more developed, however: </s></p><quote lang="Spanish"> Te acuerdas de mi casa con balcones en donde La luz de junio ahogaba flores en tu boca?</quote><p n="p7.12"><s n="s1.4;p7.12">Neruda's reference to 'balcones' symbolises the freedom of earlier days, while 'la luz de junio' is a bright image of happiness and clarity in the Spanish nation. </s><s n="s2.4;p7.12">Here, the use of flowers becomes more obvious as an allusion to poetry, suggesting that Lorca created beautiful works but his inspired voice was smothered in death. </s><s n="s3.4;p7.12">Following this metaphor, Neruda cries out to his lost friend with, 'Hermano, hermano!'. </s><s n="s4.4;p7.12">This desperate, sorrowful epithet highlights both a personal loss and the camaraderie among the grieving community. </s></p><p n="p8.12"><s n="s1.7;p8.12">The poet uses a device common to his Civil War poetry by attaching pre-revolutionary days with an abundance of food such as 'aglomeraciones de pan', 'pescados hacinados' y 'aceite'. </s><s n="s2.7;p8.12">This abundance suggests that, formerly, the citizens of Spain were fully nourished but now have an unsatisfied 'boca de sed' as mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Maldición</hi> (p.3). </s><s n="s3.7;p8.12">Neruda's choice of 'pan' and 'pescados' interestingly hints at the story of Jesus feeding the five thousand with loaves and fish, although Neruda is not openly religious. </s><s n="s4.7;p8.12">It is possible that the poet appreciates the sentiment in this biblical tale of sharing amongst the people and operating together as a community. </s><s n="s5.7;p8.12">However, Neruda also connects these images with 'latido' and 'palpitante', suggesting that perhaps the story of their nation does not hold the miracle of Jesus, but rather the stretching of limited resources among the working class people has driven them to poverty. </s><s n="s6.7;p8.12">The imbalance of wealth between the opposing forces is frequently highlighted in Neruda's poetry. </s><s n="s7.7;p8.12">This subject provides the inspiration for <hi rend="italic">Almería,</hi> which threatens 'el banquero', 'el coronel' and the 'ministros' with a 'plato de sangre silenciosa' (pp.32-34) for thickening the divide between the classes and cutting down the poor. </s></p><p n="p9.12"><s n="s1.3;p9.12">Neruda suggests he was ill-prepared for the approaching conflict by his repetition of 'y una mañana', which introduces a lengthy description of the unexpected scene in brief, quick-paced lines. </s><s n="s2.3;p9.12">Suddenly 'las hogueras' brought danger and devastation and the people were consumed, like the food he previously mentions. </s><s n="s3.3;p9.12">His repetition of 'y desde entonces' suggests that this abrupt combat affected the people for a great length of time and scarred a generation. </s></p><p n="p10.12"><s n="s1.9;p10.12">Neruda targets the perpetrators of the violence who are responsible for introducing 'pólvora' and 'cuchillos' into their peaceful nation. </s><s n="s2.9;p10.12">He repeatedly condemns them as 'bandidos', composing an alliteration of plosives that adds an accusatory bite to this title. </s><s n="s3.9;p10.12">By identifying the nationalists as 'bandidos', Neruda effectively portrays the fascists as a people who have thieved the nation of its harmony. </s><s n="s4.9;p10.12">Esenwein explains that 'for some, (the war) was a contest between Christianity and Atheism'<ref target="BAWE_0419b-ftnote.004"/> and this attitude is portrayed for the first time in this work. </s><s n="s5.9;p10.12">Neruda accuses Christians of an unforgivable hypocrisy for supporting the 'bandidos con frailes negros' who are killing innocent children. </s><s n="s6.9;p10.12">The poet highlights the Christians' disobedience to their own commandments which instruct them not to kill but to love their neighbour. </s><s n="s7.9;p10.12">Neruda expresses that these treacherous men are worse than 'víboras' as even these ruthless creatures are not as cruel as the enemy. </s><s n="s8.9;p10.12">Neruda introduces the 2 <hi rend="sup">nd</hi> person pronoun to directly command the fascist forces to 'mirad España rota' with an imperative. </s><s n="s9.9;p10.12">He demands that the enemy observes the terror they have caused before promising a repayment: </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_0419b-ftnote.004"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">George R.
