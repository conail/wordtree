character to act as a vacuum that reflects the equally vacuous dull world around her. </s><s n="s4.19;p5.10">Cristie March is keen to show that whilst Warner "glorifies and rusticates the Highlands

n="s5.19;p5.10">This evidently impacts upon Morvern's social identity and Wallace and Stevenson highlight the damaged identity common to Scottish Literature is expressed through " a failure to find -

rend="italic">Happy Days (1963)</hi> in the openness of her simplistic language and linear narrative, which suggest a child that has yet to form her social identity. </s><s n="s8.19;p5.10">Morvern makes two key ethical decisions that shape her social identity. </s><s n="s9.19;p5.10">The first is her decision not to report the death of her boyfriend and the second is the theft of his novel and essentially his identity when she puts her name on the manuscript. </s><s n="s10.19;p5.10">In this act, Warner is perhaps exploring Roland Barthes 'the death of the author' hypothesis, in which he argues that the author cannot claim any absolute authority over his or her text because 'to give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified.' </s><s n="s11.19;p5.10">Warner experiments with these ideas both in the title and content of the novel. </s><s n="s12.19;p5.10">Not only does the male author distance himself by constructing a female character, but also the name itself, <hi rend="italic">Morvern Callar,</hi> is asexual and genderless. </s><s n="s13.19;p5.10">By confusing issues of gender Warner is able to lend existential qualities to his protagonist and he is able to limit extra-diegetic interaction and therefore prevent her social identity being formed in relation to the author.This gender confusion is extended to Morvern's preoccupation with names. </s><s n="s14.19;p5.10">She plays with the construction of identity by nicknaming her stepfather 'Red Hanna' and her co-workers 'Tequila Sheila,' 'Smugslug' and ' Creeping Jesus." </s><ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.023"/><s n="s15.19;p5.10">Whilst, these names deny the character's true identity, she foregrounds the lack of her boyfriend's name by referring to him as 'He." </s><ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.024"/><s n="s16.19;p5.10">The capitalization is usually reserved for references to God and is suggestive of a divine authorship or father figure status in Morvern's life. </s><s n="s17.19;p5.10">Indeed, the large age gap between the two could perhaps be construed as Oedipal re-enaction of a father and daughter relationship. </s><s n="s18.19;p5.10">Morvern, like the characters created by Jeannette Winterson, is detached from the body she occupies and her ritualistic toe painting, smoking and obsession with clothes are not simply a preoccupation with the teen culture but an attempt to integrate her inner and outer reality. </s><s n="s19.19;p5.10">Ironically, this disjointed sense of self allows her to interact with the corpse of her dead boyfriend without ethical dilemma; 'what you do is divide the limbs and wrap them in a good few layers of bin liner.' <ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.025"/> </s></p><note place="foot"

the discrepancies between the fragmented inner 'I' and the ideal outer 'I,' the de-centred self. </s><s n="s2.12;p7.10">She is conscious that 'the one life we think we know, is only the window that is open on the screen." </s><ref target="BAWE_3001b-ftnote.033"/><s n="s3.12;p7.10">With a lack of symbolic language to describe those other windows, she questions; 'how do you write me to myself?"

series of fantasies mapped out on a laptop Winterson explores the boundaries and liminalities of gender and nomadic identity. </s><s n="s5.12;p7.10">These concerns are perhaps linked intimately to Winterson's own identity. </s><s n="s6.12;p7.10">Having run away from home at the age of sixteen because her parents did not support her lesbian identity, Winterson was forced to construct her social identity in the absence of authorial authority, In contrast to Pip in <hi rend="italic">Great Expectations</hi> who searches for his ordained place in society in order to stabilize and ensure its continuation, Winterson creates characters who rebel against the process of interpellation in search of their own personal, psychological identity. </s><s n="s7.12;p7.10">She questions how well can we ever really know ourselves and in response to this she offers a new set of politics by which to construct social identity. </s><s n="s8.12;p7.10">She constructs love affairs dotted through time and space, 'in the sixteenth century,' at 'the train station' and in 'Paris,' in order to stress that social identity is not formed through one's environment, 'place doesn't matter'<ref

also finds that names are irrelevant to identity. </s><s n="s10.12;p7.10">Winterson creates many characters all different and yet all produced by the same consciousness. </s><s n="s11.12;p7.10">She shares Barthes preoccupation with the author by sporadically establishing extra-diegetic interaction asking; 'did I write this story, or was it you, writing through me?" </s><ref
