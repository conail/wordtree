known as the 'Victorian crisis of faith' due to scientific discovery, changing philosophy and doubts over the validity of the Bible. </s><s n="s2.5;p1.20">This crisis of confidence in Christianity was experienced mostly by intellectuals who renounced the Bible as literal fact and replaced it by a humanistic religion. </s><s n="s3.5;p1.20">These changing ethics were clearly illustrated in the literature of the time; the discourses of the writing and the characters portrayed in them. </s><s n="s4.5;p1.20">Both George Eliot and Thomas Hardy were sceptical of Christianity, especially some of its strict moral standards, but both felt that its altruistic teachings were beneficial. </s><s n="s5.5;p1.20">They both used the Bible richly as a resource for their novels and I will discuss their use of it and their alternative humanism looking at Eliot's <hi rend="underlined">Silas Marner</hi> (1861) and Hardy's <hi rend="underlined">Tess of the D'Urbervilles</hi> (1891). </s></p><p

day. </s><s n="s2.7;p2.20">Eliot became especially involved in church at the age of 12 when she began teaching in Sunday school but it was not until the age of 15 when she became convinced of Evangelical Christianity. </s><s n="s3.7;p2.20">Nineteenth Century Evangelical teachings emphasised the doctrines of eternal salvation and judgement, original sin, justification through faith alone and activism. </s><s n="s4.7;p2.20">Yet there were many ambiguities; shown by new emphasises later in the century, as to how one is assured of salvation<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.001"/> and what the implications of biblical doctrines were. </s><s n="s5.7;p2.20">Preachers<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.002"/> did not see the Bible's teaching as a whole<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.003"/> and so were left to hold different human authors, such as Paul and James, in opposition to each other. </s><s n="s6.7;p2.20">People felt great unrest because they were left unaware of whether or not actions on earth determined one's salvation because they did not have a balanced biblical understanding. </s><s n="s7.7;p2.20">Amidst the confusion, Eliot felt great relief in dropping her faith,

by Silas's peculiar fits and single him out for a special role. </s><s n="s4.8;p4.20">Eliot presents Silas as a confused soul in response, not wishing to exaggerate his experiences and uncertain how to interpret them. </s><s n="s5.8;p4.20">He describes himself as being <hi rend="italic">"not in the body, but out of the body"</hi> (12) a reference to the apostle Paul (2 Corinthians 2:1-3) talking

their relationship with a special significance. </s><s n="s2.8;p5.20">Yet Eliot portrays Dane as the manipulative, superior partner and Silas as the unsure innocently influenced youth. </s><s n="s3.8;p5.20">Dane is <hi rend="italic">"faultless"</hi> (10) in Silas's eyes, whose weakness is to <hi rend="italic">"admire imperativeness and lean on contradiction"</hi> perhaps a scathing reference to Proverbs 3:5 as an image of the Christian life being one of swapping any intellectual critique in place of trust. </s><s n="s4.8;p5.20">Silas and Dane discuss assurance of salvation, and Dane's reference to a supernatural viewing of the words <hi rend="italic">"calling and election sure"</hi> (11) from 2 Peter 1:10 is a clear example of the community's Calvinistic tendencies. </s><s n="s5.8;p5.20">Yet also it shows an unbalanced understanding of the doctrine that was perhaps typical of the confusion over the subject in Eliot's day. </s><s n="s6.8;p5.20">The doctrine of God's sovereignty in predestination<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.015"/> is to be held in conjunction with people being held responsible for their actions on earth<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.016"/> and having the choice to believe or not believe in the rescue provided by Jesus.<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.017"/> Yet Dane's viewing suggests that one must discover whether one is chosen or not; in his case possessing <hi rend="italic">"unshaken assurance"</hi> leaving Silas with an honest and anxious claim of his <hi rend="italic">"hope mingled with fear".</hi> </s><s n="s7.8;p5.20">Silas's

eternity"</hi><ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.018"/>. </s><s n="s8.8;p5.20">Through the biblical discourse, Eliot has created an uncomfortable 'spiritual' atmosphere for Silas, one that represents an aspect of Christian thinking in her time, and one that both she, and Silas, are happy to abandon. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.015"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">See Ephesians

a reference to Joshua 7 when after the siege of Jericho; Achan is condemned to death for violating God's covenant by stealing possessions devoted to destruction. </s><s n="s3.10;p6.20">Dane's harsh biblical language provides him with the authority to suggest that Silas's inner evil and will are against God. </s><s n="s4.10;p6.20">Dane also questions Silas over anything he might have done to <hi rend="italic">"give Satan an advantage"</hi> (13) a reference to 2 Corinthians 2:11 where Paul is discussing forgiveness, and calls the people to forgive each other so that Satan might not outwit them. </s><s n="s5.10;p6.20">Dane uses this passage written to a community and focuses on a battle taking place in the <hi rend="italic">"secret chambers"</hi> of Silas's heart, employing a biblical reference to an imagined incident that cannot be proven. </s><s n="s6.10;p6.20">Later on in the novel Silas refers to Dane as <hi rend="italic">"mine own famil'ar friend in whom I trusted, had lifted up his heel again' me"</hi> (144) taken from David's Psalm 41:9. </s><s n="s7.10;p6.20">Yet David was able to continue and say <hi rend="italic">"But you, O Lord, have mercy on me"</hi> whereas Dane's malign treatment of Silas leads him to lose his faith in God. </s><s n="s8.10;p6.20">Throughout Silas's accusation, he repeats the phrase <hi rend="italic">"God will clear me"</hi> being confident of his innocence, yet the lots fail to provide the divine intervention of justice that Silas expects but instead suggest Dane's manipulation of the naïve religious community. </s><s n="s9.10;p6.20">Silas's distress at his <hi rend="italic">"disappointed faith"</hi> (14) seems the inevitable reaction to the lots which falsely proclaim Silas's guilt. </s><s n="s10.10;p6.20">When Silas relays the events later to Dolly, she summarizes by saying </s></p><quote lang="English"><hi rend="italic">"if Them above had done the right thing by you, They'd never ha' let you be turned out for a wicked thief when you was innicent"</hi> (143).</quote><p n="p7.20"><s n="s1.2;p7.20">Dolly's unconventional way of referring to God in his Trinitarian form perhaps suggests poor understanding or intelligence rather than familiarisation, yet I think Eliot is emphasizing her innocent care for Silas in opposition to the seemingly distant or non-existent God. </s><s n="s2.2;p7.20">On one hand Eliot is showing Dolly's naivety and therefore the manipulation of the Raveloe church, but on the other hand, the church that does not take doctrine too seriously is congratulated because it is mostly concerned for the community companionship and goodwill that Eliot believes in. </s></p><p n="p8.20"><s n="s1.9;p8.20">Silas's deep felt anger at the injustice so infuriates him, he proclaims, <hi rend="italic">"There is no just God that governs the earth righteously, but a God of lies, that bears witness against the innocent"</hi> (14). </s><s n="s2.9;p8.20">This unequivocal blasphemy denies the God of the Bible<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.019"/> and reminds the reader of Job who cried out to God for mercy<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.020"/> and yet received none despite his innocence. </s><s n="s3.9;p8.20">Job was a rich and powerful man, blameless and upright and a man who feared God. </s><s n="s4.9;p8.20">Yet God let Satan test him and took away all he had. </s><s n="s5.9;p8.20">Job never cursed God in quite the same way as Silas but still despaired at the God who he claimed <hi rend="italic">"denied me justice"</hi> (Job 27:22). </s><s n="s6.9;p8.20">Job is encouraged by his wife to curse God<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.021"/> but he never did and God rewarded him by revealing to him his sovereignty,<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.022"/> answering his call for a mediator between God and man in Jesus Christ<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.023"/> and rewarding him by giving him twice as much as he originally had.<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.024"/> Although Silas's experience does in fact lead him to reject God (who Eliot claims does not exist) he in the same way is innocently punished and yet rewarded. </s><s n="s7.9;p8.20">Silas's comforters (80) are also reminiscent of Job's<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.025"/> and both have friends, in Dane and Eliphaz<ref target="BAWE_3003a-ftnote.026"/> who suggest that their judgement is just, due to their actions. </s><s n="s8.9;p8.20">The rich comparison of the two and Silas's new discovery of community life introduces the god of Eliot's humanitarian religion, the god of love between humans in relationship to each other. </s><s n="s9.9;p8.20">Silas is not only originally comforted by the people of Raveloe after 15 years but it is through the mysterious gift of Eppie that he is enabled to
