perhaps key 'Intra-textual technique' - the cut-up." </s><ref target="BAWE_3006a-ftnote.002"/><s n="s4.7;p4.23">The way in which the text is broken up leads to the juxtaposition of contrasting initial

the end of the second verse appears to be the object of the statement. </s><s n="s7.7;p4.23">However, the tone of the letter changes in a humorous way when we read the opening of stanza three, to

heritage." </s><ref target="BAWE_3006a-ftnote.003"/><s n="s3.5;p5.23">The central character, 'Rude boy Q', is being accused of practicing this Creole both in speech and writing. </s><s

accepted contemporary forms. </s><s n="s2.3;p6.23">Although the enjambment between stanzas four and five is ironic, since the reader is also not 'looking', the effect of this, as with other occasions in the text, is that the verse is disjointed. </s><s n="s3.3;p6.23">This is also apparent in Petrucci's <hi rend="italic">Reflections</hi>, between stanzas two and three, where the simile 'black / as a space-time singularity,' is divided. </s></p><p n="p7.23"><s n="s1.2;p7.23">On other occasions, in <hi rend="italic">Judge Dreadword</hi> the enjambment creates tone through the encouragement of stress on certain words. </s><s n="s2.2;p7.23">An example of this is line eighteen when the vowel sound of 'every day'' becomes stressed and hard because it has been placed at the start of the line. </s></p><p n="p8.23"><s n="s1.1;p8.23">In order to demonstrate their chosen theme, the poems <hi rend="italic">Mutations</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Judge Dreadword</hi> manipulate traditional ideas and forms to achieve the poets' desired effects. </s></p><p n="p9.23"><s n="s1.6;p9.23">In <hi rend="italic">Mutations</hi> Petrucci's experimentation is one of "implicit Intertextuality"; taking a "reader orientated" text and translating "not between languages, but from one discipline to another." </s><s n="s2.6;p9.23">This, he describes as a "Centrifugal tactic". </s><ref

inverted stress in the first foot of the line, then using poeclectic tactics and genetic variation<ref target="BAWE_3006a-ftnote.005"/> he 'mutate[s]' the first line, developing it into a contrasting, sinister phrase. </s><s n="s4.6;p9.23">Petrucci demonstrates how the alteration of vowel sounds, stresses and grammar can change, not only what the text means, but how it sounds. </s><s n="s5.6;p9.23">As a piece of performance poetry its true effect can only be fully understood when it is read aloud. </s><s n="s6.6;p9.23">Written phonetically it is "astonishing to arrive at that

there is ellipsis of the word 'of' between 'all' and 'my'. </s><s n="s3.3;p10.23">The main way Questel demonstrates this theme however, is through the content of the poem and his use - or misuse - of

techniques employed such as rhyme in the penultimate stanza ('interrupt' and 'corrupt'), and part rhyme in the first and second stanzas ('necks' and 'next', 'without' and 'mouth'); there are also several examples of alliteration, such as in the ninth stanza, 'product of proven tradition'. </s><s n="s3.3;p14.23">The repeated 'P' gives a momentary sense of rhythm and infuses a dramatically angry

</s><s n="s2.4;p15.23">Aloud, it reads as a dramatic dialogue which, on a macro-textual level, can be analysed through the power relations and social rules of the speakers; the Judge holds a higher status and thus has authority over 'Rude boy Q'. </s><s n="s3.4;p15.23">This is demonstrated through his repeated use of imperatives, 'Hush up'; 'Don't interrupt'. </s><s n="s4.4;p15.23">It might be

different poetic techniques, such as alliteration (Hills as old as hats) and the repetition of the 't' sound in the third line to create a tone that prevents the inversions becoming "facile humour" and "manages to reverse the logic of cliché to [a] distinctly non-comic effect".<ref target="BAWE_3006a-ftnote.013"/> This illustrates clearly how the manipulation of the familiar can create something

title of the poem. </s><s n="s3.4;p17.23">The feet measurements of each line are, in most cases, a reversal ('reflection') or close opposite of another line close to it. </s><s n="s4.4;p17.23">The

evolvement of traditional English, is that of direct speech. </s><s n="s2.5;p21.23">Although the dramatic scene is introduced to us by 'Rude boy Q', there is no consistent narrator. </s><s n="s3.5;p21.23">As a consequence, the poem is filled with deictics and other common features of speech, such as interruption. </s><s n="s4.5;p21.23">Other than three direct answers, however, the speech of the defendant is no longer included after the first two stanzas, thus interruptions are implied: "Don't interrupt". </s><s n="s5.5;p21.23">Since it is face to face contact there is also implicit physical action: "you snivel in my court"; the poem is dependent on the atmosphere set by the writer through such techniques and dramatic language. </s></p><p n="p22.23"><s
