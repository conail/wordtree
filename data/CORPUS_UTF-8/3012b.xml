number of Dickens's novels and proceed by following the chronology of their publication. </s><s n="s2.17;p4.10">Miller explores six novels and analyses them as the transformation of the real world of Dickens into an imaginary world with certain special qualities of its own. </s><s n="s3.17;p4.10">He argues that "throughout all the swarming multiplicity of his novels", Dickens created a "world which is unique and the same".<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.010"/> Miller points out that the element which presides at the centre of the imaginative universe of Dickens is the "great modern commercial city"<ref target="BAWE_3012b-ftnote.011"/> and he underlines Dickens's interpretation of the city-world. </s><s n="s4.17;p4.10">Schwarzbach's approach is similar to Miller's but if the latter analyses the world of Dickens in general, the former focuses on the treatment of the city only. </s><s n="s5.17;p4.10">Schwarzbach stresses that London played an important role in Dickens's own life and is at the centre of the novelist creative imagination. </s><s n="s6.17;p4.10">His work explores the Victorian writer's approach to the city and examines how it evolves through his novels. </s><s n="s7.17;p4.10">As for Welsh, he presents Dickens's treatment of the city as a great metaphor. </s><s n="s8.17;p4.10">At the difference of the two critics previously mentioned, he is more concerned by the symbolic meanings of the novelist's portrayal of London than the descriptions in themselves. </s><s n="s9.17;p4.10">Welsh divides his study in themes which are symbolically related to the Dickensian city. </s><s n="s10.17;p4.10">For example, he underlines the association of London with death and hell, greed and money, or the hearth and home in the different works of the novelist.

incorporated his personal approach and experience of the city into his work. </s><s n="s13.17;p4.10">As for Baumgarten and Deutschendorf, both critics underline the connection between Dickens's characters and London and the way the novelist used the city as a reflection of his protagonists' personalities. </s><s n="s14.17;p4.10">All these different critical texts encompass a period of thirty five years, Miller's book was written in 1970 whereas Deutschendorf's article was published in 2005. </s><s n="s15.17;p4.10">Despite the gap in time, these various studies share many characteristics,
