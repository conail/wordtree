Room ratio, they have been separated to allow management the correct analysis and hence, the appropriate measures to reduce such costs. </s><s n="s4.5;p18.73">Payroll cost ratio is relatively important because payroll constitutes a high cost, especially in the following department (sometimes unnecessarily) and this ratio will clarify how much staff costs per customer (Riley, 2000). </s><s n="s5.5;p18.73">As these ratios will be repeated in the following departments, although with different figures, their explanation will not be gone over. </s></p></div3><div3><head rend="bold">2.1.6 Conclusion</head><p n="p19.73"><s n="s1.7;p19.73">It is crucial to regard both costs and revenues, and variances in terms of percentages and money. </s><s n="s2.7;p19.73">Analysing percentages helps pin-point the problem (Burgess, 2001). </s><s n="s3.7;p19.73">In the rooms department, there is an increase of 6.4% in sales, whilst costs have risen 2.6%. </s><s n="s4.7;p19.73">It is also important to note, where, within the costs, there are high variances. </s><s n="s5.7;p19.73">There is an increase of 8.5% between actual and budgeted travel agent commissions, followed by 7.0% in guest supplies and a decline of 6.1 % in linen and laundry. </s><s n="s6.7;p19.73">It is important to note that a variance which indicates a decrease may have both positive and negative effects being the duty of the manager to identify and justify occurring gaps (Burgess, 2001). </s><s n="s7.7;p19.73">The advantage of the departmental P&amp;L is that by separating all costs and determining the marginal costs, there is the possibility of efficient and effective measures to reduce high costs (Chin et al 1995). </s></p></div3></div2><div2><head rend="bold">2.2 Food and Beverage Department</head><div3><head rend="bold">2.2.1 Introduction</head><p n="p20.73"><s n="s1.2;p20.73">Food and beverage factors to evaluate performance are quite similar to the rooms department, meaning they focus on volume and price. </s><s n="s2.2;p20.73">Seat turnover and the average spend per customer are the most used measures to assess F&amp;B performance (Chin et al 1995). </s></p></div3><div3><head rend="bold">2.2.1 Sales</head><p n="p21.73"><s n="s1.2;p21.73">The increase in occupancy, and hence, number of guests in the hotel may be a cause for the raise in F&amp;B sales, when compared to the budget; also, a change in menu items or a more detailed menu engineering (Fattorini, 2001)-possibly rising the inclusion of dishes with a higher contribution margin-may have the same effects, as well product - bundle pricing, where many products are joined and sold at a cheaper price (Kotler et al, 2003). </s><s n="s2.2;p21.73">Additionally, if managers want to further increase sales, and consequently revenue, it may be necessary to implement actions in order to raise the percentage of beverage sales, as these items are a fast way of increasing revenue (Fattorini, 2001). </s></p></div3><div3><head rend="bold">2.2.2 Cost of Sales</head><p n="p22.73"><s n="s1.1;p22.73">It is in this department that costs are higher than other sections as all raw materials must be considered, and managers must try to keep costs adequate, as a large decrease in costs may have negative consequences, connected to a decline in quality (Chin et al 1995). </s></p><p n="p23.73"><s n="s1.5;p23.73">Cost of sales has also risen, when compared to budget, almost in the same proportion as the increase of sales. </s><s n="s2.5;p23.73">It is clear to notice, that when sales rise, there is a larger need of raw material and therefore costs will relatively increase as well. </s><s n="s3.5;p23.73">In this situation, seat turnover cannot be calculated, as the number of seats available is not provided, however it is possible to compare average spends per cover, concluding that food spend per cover has risen, however, beverage spend has decreased. </s><s n="s4.5;p23.73">Managers may concentrate on increasing beverage spends, controlling beverage costs and working on an even higher increase in sales. </s><s n="s5.5;p23.73">Unnecessary wastage caused by carelessness in calculating correct quantities of food items or inappropriate attitudes of staff towards food (Brugess, 2001) destined to customers may be reasons justifying an increase in average food spend. </s></p><p n="p24.73"><s n="s1.2;p24.73">The av. spend per cover allows the hotel to identify which products and areas are generating more revenue (Burgess, 2001). </s><s n="s2.2;p24.73">In this situation, customers are spending more money on food than budgeted and less on beverage. </s></p><p n="p25.73"><s n="s1.4;p25.73">The above is also directly related to the percentage of beverage sales to food sales;

therefore most customers choose alternative forms of communication such as their own mobile phone or calling cards. </s><s n="s2.5;p33.73">The problem with calling cards is that the guest still uses the phone provided by the hotel, so as a measure to reduce the incidence of such actions, some hotels either charge a rate for the usage of the telephone or do not allow calling cards. </s><s n="s3.5;p33.73">The logical consequence is that guests may not like such tactics and subsequently, not come back (Chin et al, 1995). </s><s n="s4.5;p33.73">The bare truth is that, small establishments have more fixed costs than variable ones, and therefore, a rise in sales causes a growth in profit (Kotas &amp;
