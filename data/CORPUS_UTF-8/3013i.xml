Business Environment</head><p n="p6.39"><s n="s1.2;p6.39">The PESTE framework was chosen to compare UK and Korean business environments and analyse the impact of cultural differences on people management approaches as it provides an overview of the countries' macro-environment, pinpointing challenges and opportunities and suggesting the level of adaptability needed for people management techniques (Rowley &amp; Bae, 2004; Brewster &amp; Tyson, 1991; Zhu &amp; Warner, 2004). </s><s n="s2.2;p6.39">Elements of business systems theory, which suggests a country's institutions affect people management (Brewster, 2006), are used alongside cultural differences to justify diverse practices (Sorge, 2004). </s></p><p n="p7.39"><s n="s1.6;p7.39">Many definitions of 'culture' exist because it is a term applied in various social sciences and domains. </s><s n="s2.6;p7.39">Nonetheless, these are cohesive in stating culture as a combination of different factors, implied (i.e. morals and customs) and apparent (i.e. conduct), where fundamental beliefs are portrayed in behaviour (Groeschl &amp; Doherty, 2000). </s><s n="s3.6;p7.39">Hofstede &amp; Hofstede (2005) add that culture is so deeply-rooted it explains national differences (e.g. the role of the government, approaches to work, legislative structure, economy and demographics). </s><s n="s4.6;p7.39">A connection is then established that the culturalist and the institutionalist perspectives are interdependent and both influence HRM policies (Brewster, 2006; Sorge, 2004). </s><s n="s5.6;p7.39">Consequently, cultural justifications are provided throughout the analysis to validate UK and South Korean institutional differences. </s><s n="s6.6;p7.39">Important to mention however, that Hofstede's arguments are based on research performed over two decades ago and their reliability (Brewster, 2006; Pizam, Pine, Mok &amp; Shin, 1997), especially in South Korea's case is questionable due to recent changes. </s></p><p n="p8.39"><s n="s1.15;p8.39">Korea's favourable economic situation with rising rate of growth and GNI per capita offers many business opportunities for foreign direct investment (FDI)-appendix 2. </s><s n="s2.15;p8.39">Recent government efforts showing the country's openness to internationalisation are proven by policies restructuring the economy and reforming employment laws (World Bank, 2004), free trade agreements (FTA), mainly with the US (Foreign Relations News, 2006)-appendix 2-and sanctions on businesses (for restaurants the max. fine is 500.000 won) if they do not adopt the international metric system (Nation News, 2006). </s><s n="s3.15;p8.39">These changes have resulted in Korea becoming the twelfth largest world economy (BBC, 2006), and adding to the mentioned positive political and economic changes, assist hospitality organizations entering the country. </s><s n="s4.15;p8.39">Korea, however, was not always this "open"; until recently it had major government corruption, suggestions of which still remain (U.S Library of Congress, 2005; appendix 2). </s><s n="s5.15;p8.39">A striking difference in policies between the UK and Korea is the amount of strict regulations, detailed formalities and government intervention in public and private affairs (taxation, education, politics-appendix 2) in the latter in comparison to the apparently deregulated UK (appendix 2). </s><s n="s6.15;p8.39">Hofstede &amp; Hofstede (2005) suggest this is typical of collectivist societies (appendix 3), where government intervention is justified by protecting the interests of the whole over the individual. </s><s n="s7.15;p8.39">Economic indications of collectivist societies (predominant in Asia) include reduced wealth (Korea's GNI per capita is lower than UK figures-appendix 2), the existence and influence of <hi rend="italic">chaebols</hi> in a country's economy and the use of force to implement new economic practices-e.g. severe fines for small business if they do not implement the international metric system-(Hofstede, 2001). </s><s n="s8.15;p8.39">On the other hand, the UK's political environment and low government intervention propose a high regard for individual interests reflected in strong values for social justice and human rights and each council determining its planning regulations (appendix 2). </s><s n="s9.15;p8.39">Economic evidences of individuality are seen in free-market policies which encourage competition, significantly higher levels of wealth (appendix 2), and emphasis on freedom (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s><s n="s10.15;p8.39">The UK's lack of formality and rules suggests people are more relaxed and ambiguity tolerant, the absolute opposite is seen in Korea and reflected in the degree of uncertainty avoidance (UA)-appendix 3. </s><s n="s11.15;p8.39">Collectivism is also reflected in the existence and power of trade unions. </s><s n="s12.15;p8.39">Although Korea is highly-unionized, this is mainly in manufacturing (Rowley &amp; Bae, 2004) with no evidence of unions in hospitality and the federations of tourism and women workers having the lowest numbers of affiliated unions and members (appendix 2). </s><s n="s13.15;p8.39">The UK in contrast, has a union for bakers and associated food workers; however its role seems to be to provide information for individual workers rather than intervention (BFAWU, 2006). </s><s n="s14.15;p8.39">Certainly the UK offers favourable conditions for investment though its market competitiveness poses survival challenges for some companies. </s><s n="s15.15;p8.39">Korea's recent government policy changes shown in increased westernization and business transparency suggest an inclination towards more individualist ideals<ref target="BAWE_3013i-ftnote.001"/>, which certainly has major advantages, when competing with some neighbouring Asian countries, to attract FDI. Comparing the two countries' political and economic landscapes, and contrasting the UK's prevalent values of autonomy, self-interest and competition, with Korea's control, formality and group values, it is clear that Saint Fusion Korea's people management approaches should be contextualised and include group management and strong manager-staff relationships where status is emphasized yet moderated with goodwill (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_3013i-ftnote.001"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.2;pn1.1">The argument that countries may have moved along a particular dimension since Hofstede's study is supported by Pizam <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s2.2;pn1.1">(1997). </s></p></note><p n="p9.39"><s n="s1.10;p9.39">In response to neighbouring booming and large-scale economies, which highlight high cost production and constrain export potential (Tong-soo, 2006), Korea is tackling its internal problems, to attract FDI, by improving labour market policies (About Korea, 2006a), introducing flexible work (appendix 5) rising the retirement age, and legislating age/women discrimination acts (About Korea, 2006a). </s><s n="s2.10;p9.39">Further efforts include opening job centres, the introduction of an annual pay system (Rowley &amp; Bae, 2004) and making work insurance available to everyone-only implemented in 2003 (U.S. Library of Congress, 2005). </s><s n="s3.10;p9.39">These new policies significantly affect hospitality (especially greater female participation) and mainly the bakery sector which needs flexible shifts and working hours to maximize labour productivity. </s><s n="s4.10;p9.39">However, despite the improvements, there are still many stiff regulations regarding employability in Korea (appendix 4). </s><s n="s5.10;p9.39">Nonetheless, apart from reflecting greater gender equality, flexible work (appendix 5) demonstrates Korea's feminism, where a work/life balance is crucial, both genders have the same opportunities for the same vocations and there is a prevalence of service industry jobs (appendix 2)-Hofstede, 2001. </s><s n="s6.10;p9.39">The UK on the other hand, is a masculine country (appendix 3), where gender roles are still rather differentiated, competition dominates and returns are impartial. </s><s n="s7.10;p9.39">As female participation in the workforce is not a reflection of feminism (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005), the UK's tightening gap between male and female work participation is attributed to improving attitudes towards working women, their increasing qualifications and returning to work after having children (UK National Statistics, 2005). </s><s n="s8.10;p9.39">The OECD (2006) asserts wage differences between male and female workers relate to the amount of time women spend in the labour force, the jobs they choose and the high incidence of part-time employment (appendix 2). </s><s n="s9.10;p9.39">Further evidence suggesting masculinity and specific gender roles is the very low number of working mums, especially with children under five. </s><s n="s10.10;p9.39">To adapt to Korea's feminine culture Saint Fusion should foster pleasant relationships between superiors and subordinates and cooperation, opposing its UK aim of inculcating a sense of accomplishment and job recognition- typical of masculine societies (Romani, 2004). </s></p><p n="p10.39"><s n="s1.9;p10.39">Socio-cultural challenges for hospitality businesses in Korea include a homogeneous population, predominance of the national language, social class and Confucianism (appendix 2); which refer to different aspects of culture (Usinier &amp; Lee, 2005) and prove high levels of UA (appendix 3)-a geographical characteristic (Hofstede, 2001). </s><s n="s2.9;p10.39">Conversely, UK's high immigration levels have brought diverse languages, ethnicities, nationalities, levels of education, types of profession, and religions, and consequently innovation and diversity (UK National Statistics, 2005), proving much tolerance towards difference and uncertainty (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s><s n="s3.9;p10.39">Further implications lie in how people regard social disparity and their association with power. </s><s n="s4.9;p10.39">In the UK, status and power are unimportant, however in Korea, these are differentiators of social class, linked to greater respect, formality (Usinier &amp; Lee, 2005) and believed to bring stability through social inequality (power distance-PD), though also balanced with a greater sense of responsibility (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s><s n="s5.9;p10.39">PD is found in societies where there are wage discrepancies and evidence of violence in the country's politics (Hofstede, 2001). </s><s n="s6.9;p10.39">Korea, which ranked above average in PD (appendix 3), shows recent evidence of oppression, violence and corruption in its government and women earn half of men's wages (appendix 2); however, this figure is contradicted, at least in the hotel industry, with the ILO's (2006) figures on male/female wages (appendix 2), and importantly, Hofstede (2001) states PD relates to wage disparities at an organizational level and not gender differences. </s><s n="s7.9;p10.39">The situation in the UK is much different (low PD-appendix 3), there are no indices of internal political violence, and emphasis is on low hierarchical structures, equality, small wage differences and consultation before decision-making. </s><s n="s8.9;p10.39">Further reflections of high PD in Korea which need to be considered are the submission of the weak, extensive hierarchies, concentration of power and the idea that social inequality is a norm (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s><s n="s9.9;p10.39">The implications of PD on Saint Fusion Korea's HRM strategy are significant and more rigid organizational structures, with increased hierarchical levels, and a broader range of salaries is to be considered. </s></p><p n="p11.39"><s n="s1.4;p11.39">Social inequality and collectivism mentioned above are also characteristic of Confucianism, a set of ethical principles predominant in Asia, which additionally includes perseverance, keeping "face", education, hard work, sacrifice and the prevalence of relationships over duty-<hi rend="italic">guanxi</hi> (Usinier &amp; Lee, 2005). </s><s n="s2.4;p11.39">The emphasis on immediate work for future rewards gives Korean society a long-term orientation-LTO (appendix 3). </s><s n="s3.4;p11.39">Though Confucianism justifies Korea's highly qualified labour market and equips organizations with skilled workforces (appendix 2), its LTO also demands significant changes to human resources management (HRM) from what is practised in the UK, as the latter is characterized by a focus on immediate outcomes, importance of jobs over relationships and tradition-short-term orientation-STO (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s><s n="s4.4;p11.39">Saint Fusion Korea's HRM managers should consider longer contracts and increased training/skills development opportunities (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005), which oppose the UK's focus on immediate results (Romani, 2004). </s></p><p n="p12.39"><s n="s1.3;p12.39">Technological progress (appendix 2) in both countries is precious for hospitality success, enabling companies to adapt to both converging and non-converging cultural elements. </s><s n="s2.3;p12.39">Technology's impact on HRM is the need for highly skilled professionals to use it, e.g. in the UK, professional managers are needed to interpret soft data so to identify trends. </s><s n="s3.3;p12.39">Given that Saint Fusion will apply these ICT developments in Korea, the same specialised skills should be looked for in managers. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">3. Strategic Orientation for People Management</head><p n="p13.39"><s n="s1.7;p13.39">A company's strategic people management orientation depends on the host-country's national and organizational cultures. </s><s n="s2.7;p13.39">International companies moving into new countries are more likely to find their culture eventually assimilate that of the host country, rather than their host country employees' beliefs altered by the organizational culture (Hodgetts &amp; Luthans, 1997). </s><s n="s3.7;p13.39">Additional influences in determining centricity profiles include targets market characteristics and origin (Doherty, 1998), expansion strategy, home-country influence (Roper, Brookes, Price &amp; Hampton, 1997) and employment regulations (Harzing, 2004). </s><s n="s4.7;p13.39">Three different perspectives determine centricity, namely the management mind-set, the companies' tendencies and the host-country manager's perspective, resulting in polycentrism, geocentrism and ethnocentrism (Roper <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s5.7;p13.39">, 1997). </s><s n="s6.7;p13.39">Harris, Brewster &amp;

low hierarchical levels in the UK oppose significant PD in Korea (Hofstede, 2001), and would confuse host-country nationals as to their relationship with superiors; young UK managers in a context where father-figure superiors are sought after, representing status and power, would not be appreciated by staff; UK nationals would have difficulty understanding the collectivist nature of the workforce (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s></p><p n="p15.39"><s n="s1.4;p15.39">As a mindset, polycentrism holds that host-country nationals are the best to show loyalty and understanding towards their country's institutions and culture (Roper <hi rend="italic"> et al.,</hi> 1997), hunce crucial to work in the host country (Doherty, 1998). </s><s n="s2.4;p15.39">Polycentrism is most common in adaptive organizations that give subsidiaries decision-making independence (Harris <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s3.4;p15.39">1997) and tailor people management policies (Doherty, 1998). </s><s n="s4.4;p15.39">Though convenient in countries where legal, political and significant cultural differences persist it does challenge a company's ability to offer a consistent product, especially if it is a multinational group (Usinier &amp;

Managing Diversity</head><p n="p36.39"><s n="s1.11;p36.39">Equal opportunities (EO) and diversity management (DM) are crucial topics for international companies given increased immigration, greater mobility and demographic and employment law changes (Price, 1997; Groeschl &amp; Doherty, 1999). </s><s n="s2.11;p36.39">However culture also influences the extent of EO and DM efficiency. </s><s n="s3.11;p36.39">The former concept focuses on implementing legislation and structural changes to reduce discrimination and encourage greater participation of minorities in employment (McCourt, 2003; Price, 1997), including discrimination acts, positive action (dealing with demand) and positive training (dealing with supply) (McCourt, 2003) and cover areas including gender, race, ethnicity, disability and religion (Torrington <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s4.11;p36.39">, 2005). </s><s n="s5.11;p36.39">It assumes the misleading premise that having employed ethnic minorities, staff perceptions will change. </s><s n="s6.11;p36.39">The understanding that cultural changes are needed alongside EO and affirmative action (AA), resulted in DM, with a business aim to maximize the diverse workforce (all included) as part of the organization's strategy to increase profitability (Groeschl &amp; Doherty, 1999 Harris <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s7.11;p36.39">, 2003), ideal in high discretion tasks and less efficient in routine jobs (appendix 7). </s><s n="s8.11;p36.39">Multicultural workforces increase innovation, diverse solutions, staff loyalty, improve performance, productivity, cut recruiting costs and enhance decision-making (Price, 2000; Hodgetts &amp; Luthans, 1997). </s><s n="s9.11;p36.39">The benefits of multiculturalism are questionable in relation to Korea, as obedience is a trait of the culture, especially towards those hierarchically higher. </s><s n="s10.11;p36.39">Diversity may also cause challenges for homogenous and collectivist societies, with high PD, feminism and low UA (appendix 3) due to lack of structure, diverse perceptions and communication barriers (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s><s n="s11.11;p36.39">EO and DM are therefore both needed, the first to influence behaviour and the latter to focus on changing organizational culture. </s></p><p n="p37.39"><s n="s1.4;p37.39">Contradicting evidence that minorities are found mostly at lower levels of organizations (Price, 2000; Goeschl &amp; Doherty, 1999), Korea's homogenous population and cultural characteristics (see Business Environment), and Saint Fusion's source of operative staff hinder DM related to ethnic minorities. </s><s n="s2.4;p37.39">However, the government has made several changes to provide EO, including age and women discrimination acts, extending the retirement age, improving pay systems, some de-regulation of employment laws, subsidies for companies that introduce shift work and employment support programs for young workers ("YES") and the homeless ("RESTART") (About Korea, 2006a). </s><s n="s3.4;p37.39">Though considerable, these changes show a lack of consideration for ethnicity, religion, disability or race. </s><s n="s4.4;p37.39">This may be justified by Korea's ethnic homogeneity, related to cultural values such as the importance of social networks or shame towards disabled people (contradicted by Korea's feminism), particularism, ethnic prejudice and xenophobia and intolerance towards immigrants-see work permits in appendix 6 (Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005). </s></p><p n="p38.39"><s n="s1.4;p38.39">Considering Saint Fusion is all about synthesis and its target markets appreciate diversity (appendix 1), personnel managers should focus on providing EO and fairness to as many employees possible from diverse backgrounds (though regarding ethnicity/nationality, this may only extend to a minute Chinese community-appendix 2). </s><s n="s2.4;p38.39">This should be achieved by implementing and monitoring legislation (equal chance), and equal access through Saint Fusion's entry points (Price, 2000). </s><s n="s3.4;p38.39">They should also take into account Saint Fusion's use of PM at operative level, link between PM and EO, practical implications of the above cultural values, and evidence showing these are not change with EO. Conversely, DM approaches will be inherently evident if Saint Fusion follows the resourcing and T&amp;D recommendations, by recruiting managers from across the region and mobilizing them to gain new experiences. </s><s n="s4.4;p38.39">It is hoped that contact between culturally diverse managers and their operative staff, in addition to legislation towards EO and Saint Fusion's efforts to implement it, will eventually generate a multicultural workforce, which apart from increasing novelty and business performance will mirror the company's European and North American employees. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">9.
