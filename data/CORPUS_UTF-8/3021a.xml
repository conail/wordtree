at the same time he is seen by the mask and thirdly he sees himself transmogrified in some deity or demon", illustrates Sakabe and leads us to the next section. </s></p><p n="p5.7"><s n="s1.3;p5.7">Idea of strictly reversible and reversible visibility and invisibility in Japanese thought are explored in the third part. </s><s n="s2.3;p5.7">Using the example of a <hi rend="italic">no</hi> actor, Sakabe demonstrates the significance of 'detached view' by using Motokiyo Zeami's words: "an actor must come to have an ability to see himself as the spectators do, grasp the logic of the fact that the eyes cannot see themselves, and find the skill to grasp the whole - left, right, ahead and behind." </s><s n="s3.3;p5.7">Because <hi rend="italic">omote</hi> also means 'surface', it can again be used to describe this relationship; there is a play of identity and difference, grids of surfaces which are reversible into one another and reflected back (also in song 'utai' and chorus 'ji-utai', in interchangeable characters on the scene and so on...) </s></p><p n="p6.7"><s n="s1.4;p6.7">The next section commences with the second main concept - the <hi rend="italic">kage</hi>, which controversially means 'shade, reflection, light'. </s><s n="s2.4;p6.7">Sakabe argues that shade and light are the same (transparent shade of the glass bottle = way of both being entirely terrestrial) and therefore nothing exists but reflections, shades, images <hi rend="italic">kage,</hi> and thus nothing exists but what is reflected in succession or reciprocally; what can be called changing, happening or infinite transmogrification. </s><s n="s3.4;p6.7">Taking yet another term <hi rend="italic">utsutsu</hi> (to be conscious of the actual presence of something, to be awake) and subsequently <hi rend="italic">yume-utsutsu</hi> (<hi rend="italic">yume =</hi> dream + <hi rend="italic">utsutsu =</hi> consciousness) Sakabe brings us to think of the concept such that we cannot tell exactly which of the domains (dream or 'reality') is the reflection and which is the original; 'which one is the truest and deepest reality: the image or its reflection in the deep water'. </s><s n="s4.4;p6.7">And this is exactly what happens on the <hi rend="italic">no</hi> stage: the actor being nothing but a reflection of something unseen and transcendental, as Sakabe concludes in this section. </s></p><p n="p7.7"><s n="s1.2;p7.7">The final conclusion reached in the last paragraphs of the chapter can be expressed, as Sakabe says, using Goethe's famous quote "<hi rend="italic">Everything that goes by in this Earthly world in nothing but metaphor</hi>". </s><s n="s2.2;p7.7">It is exactly this feeling, according to the author, that the Japanese traditionally always attempted to recreate in 'light gestures that are very reduced or slightly ritualized', like raising hand or gently tilting the mask... </s></p></div1></body><back><div1 type="bibliography"><head>Bibliography</head><p>Sakabe, Megumi (1999) <hi rend="italic">Mask and Shadow in Japanese Culture: Implicit Ontology in Japanese Thought,</hi> chapter 10 in book by Marra Michelle (1999) <hi rend="italic">Modern Japanese Aesthetics</hi>, Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press</p></div1></back></text></TEI.2>
