A gene could be defined as any hereditary information for which there is a favourable or unfavourable selection bias equal to several or many times its rate of endogenous exchange. (1966: 26)</quote><p n="p2.75"><s n="s1.5;p2.75">For Dawkins, a gene is defined as any portion of a chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection, a genetic unit small enough not to be frequently split by crossing-over during meiosis (which could constituted of many cistrons), and to be distributed around in the form of many copies. </s><s n="s2.5;p2.75">In Dawkins's words 'a gene is a replicator of high copying fidelity' (1989: 28). </s><s n="s3.5;p2.75">For such a genetic unit to be selected, and proliferate in individual 'survival machines' the predominant quality to be expected to in the successful gene is ruthless selfishness. </s><s n="s4.5;p2.75">This gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behaviour. </s><s n="s5.5;p2.75">However, there are circumstances exist in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of altruism at the level of individuals. </s></p><p n="p3.75"><s n="s1.10;p3.75">The apparently suicidal altruistic acts observable in some social species has led theorists such as V.

Zahavi (1977) who suggests the act of the gazelle is primarily selected as a signal to the predator, roughly translated it means: "Look how high I can jump, I am obviously such a fir and healthy gazelle, you can't catch me, you would be much wiser to try and catch my neighbour who is not jumping so high!" </s><s n="s7.10;p3.75">(1989: 171). </s><s n="s8.10;p3.75">Many mammal predators tend to attack the easy to catch, the old and weak, so in this respect the gazelle advertising its fitness in an exaggerated way is showing that it is neither old nor weak, and that the predator should look to his neighbours for a meal. </s><s n="s9.10;p3.75">Living in large groups has its individual selfish benefits, benefiting a gene for 'stotting' within the individual survival machine. </s><s n="s10.10;p3.75">According to this theory the gazelle's display is far from altruistic. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="italic">2) Altruism and Kin Selection</head><p n="p4.75"><s n="s1.6;p4.75">Prior to 1964, no theorist had come up with a satisfactory answer to the apparent altruistic acts that some individuals perform within groups. </s><s n="s2.6;p4.75">An example of this could be a group of vervet monkeys (Cheney &amp; Seyfarth) an individual within which gives off an alarm call in sight of a various predators, though making itself more conspicuous. </s><s n="s3.6;p4.75">The question was; how does such an altruistic behaviour arise in evolutionary terms when it so obviously lowers the genetic fitness of the individual giving the call? </s><s n="s4.6;p4.75">And in comparison raises fitness of the individuals of the rest of the group who did not call, and can not call. </s><s n="s5.6;p4.75">As shown with the failings of group selection behaviours can not be selected just because they are beneficial to the group as a whole. </s><s n="s6.6;p4.75">Instead according to this example selection will favour genes for suppressing calling. </s></p><quote lang="English">Natural Selection can favour altruistic behaviour if altruistic individuals are more likely to interact with each other than chance alone would dictate.

Hamilton, 1981) demonstrates the logical problems of a behaviour for exchange, and can also shed light on the selective process of evolutionary altruistic behaviour. </s><s n="s6.6;p11.75">If there is only to ever be one exchange between individuals it is always most self-serving to not to co-operate, but with iterated exchanges so called 'nice' strategies are most beneficial to the individual, the most successful by way of 'Tit-for-Tat'. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="italic">4) Innate and Environmental Influences</head><p n="p12.75"><s n="s1.6;p12.75">I'm sure the debate of this subject has been and will be contained within the covers of very many large volumes of work. </s><s n="s2.6;p12.75">It is possible to say for definite a very intimate relationship exists between what is innate within us by way of programming of genetic information, and that of facts of mere physics. </s><s n="s3.6;p12.75">When observing any organism other than ourselves (to a lesser extent maybe our closest genetic primate relatives) we can, and do easily recognise behaviour in individuals that can be generalised across all individuals within the species, behaviours that are so universal to that species that they must be innately encrypted within its genome. </s><s n="s4.6;p12.75">Multitudes of universals exist within human behaviour as documented by Donald E. Brown (1991), humans has large amount of diversity in environmental habitation, yet it is manifest we have a distinct material human nature universal to all of us, whatever our environment. </s><s n="s5.6;p12.75">If we take human language acquisition for example; opposing arguments against any theory of innateness appear thin on the ground. </s><s n="s6.6;p12.75">Chomsky himself professes to be puzzled at any objections to an innate hypothesis, in that an empirically determined language would be immediately problematic: </s></p><quote lang="English">Is the idea supposed to be that there is no [relevant] difference between my granddaughter, her pet kitten, a rock, a chimpanzee?
