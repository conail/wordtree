Both countries are political stable, and are ranked in the top in terms of level of democracy, corruption, press freedom and civil/political rights (<seg type="URL" n="www.carleton.ca"/>). </s><s n="s2.2;p5.61">They also have </s></p><p n="p6.61"><s n="s1.5;p6.61">affluent, advanced industrial economies with a farily high level of privatisation, and both Canada and the UK rank among the most developed countries in the world (<seg type="URL" n="www.eiu.com"/>). </s><s n="s2.5;p6.61">The structure of their economies is service-dominated, making them high income countries where people enjoy very high standards of living (<seg type="URL" n="www.cia.gov"/>). </s><s n="s3.5;p6.61">A concern for the Canadian economy, however, is the oil prices. </s><s n="s4.5;p6.61">Cold weather and large distances make the energy consumption in Canada double that of the G7 average. </s><s n="s5.5;p6.61">Thus, if the oil prices remain high and/or increase in the future, people will be forced to spend more on energy, which again will affect the GDP and the spending in other industries such as hospitality negatively (Tal, 2004). </s></p><p n="p7.61"><s n="s1.6;p7.61">Religion is not a major influence when conducting business either in Canada or the UK, and both countries can be identified as rather secular than religious (Nations of the World, 2004). </s><s n="s2.6;p7.61">Neither will there be any technological issues. </s><s n="s3.6;p7.61">Both countries have a well developed Information Communication Technology (ICT ) sector, and the governments are investing equally in ICT in their respective countries (<seg type="URL" n="www.oecd.org"/>). </s><s n="s4.6;p7.61">The infrastructure in Canada and the UK are of a very high level (<seg type="URL" n="www.cia.gov"/>), meaning that transportation of tourists and potential guests from international as well as domestic destinations will not become an issue. </s><s n="s5.6;p7.61">Using media as marketing channels will also be similar in the two countries, but a much higher percentage of Canada's population are connected to the internet (<seg type="URL" n="www.oecd.org"/>), giving extra opportunities to reach potential customers. </s><s n="s6.6;p7.61">(See Appendix 2 for business environment statistics). </s></p><p n="p8.61"><s n="s1.5;p8.61">In addition to the many similarities between the Canadian and British business environment, there are two major differences which will affect Perfection Hotels when entering Canada. </s><s n="s2.5;p8.61">First, Canada is a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), an agreement eliminating all tariffs between Canada, US and Mexico. </s><s n="s3.5;p8.61">It also provides a phased reduction of non-tariff barriers, making it the largest free trade zone in the world (Taplin, 2003). </s><s n="s4.5;p8.61">The UK, on the other hand, is a member of the European Union (EU), who's goal is to strenghten the economy in Europe through an internal free market within the community, with common external trade barriers to the rest of the world (Reilly, 1995). </s><s n="s5.5;p8.61">Dealing with NAFTA instead of the EU will have some economic impacts, and Perfection Hotels must also deal with a new trading system. </s></p><p n="p9.61"><s n="s1.5;p9.61">Second, the ethnic diversity in Canada makes the business environment more complicated than in the UK. Around 400 years ago, when North America was colonised, the British settled on the east coast of the US, while French people settled in Quebec and the Canadian east coast (Sherwood and Hodgkinson, 2005). </s><s n="s2.5;p9.61">The following centuries of war and conflicts between the UK and France has lead to a lot of tension between people with French and British origin (Carroll and Little, 2001). </s><s n="s3.5;p9.61">Therefore, Canada appears to be two very different countries, with 75% of the population quite like the US in most ways, and 25% with many similarities to France living mainly in Quebec (Jarvis and Thompson, 1995). </s><s n="s4.5;p9.61">However, in spite of these two major differences between Canada and the UK, the business environments in the two countries are very similar. </s><s n="s5.5;p9.61">Thus, there would be no major barriers in terms of the business environment when Perfection Hotels are establishing a hotel operation in Canada. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Demand Factors</head><p n="p10.61"><s n="s1.3;p10.61">Before expanding internationally, Perfection Hotels must establish the demand for their luxury services in the country. </s><s n="s2.3;p10.61">Middleton and Clarke (2001) concludes that the underlying factors for travel and tourism demand are the same in all countries, and Kotler <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s><s n="s3.3;p10.61">(2003) argues that the economic variables are the most important set of factors influencing the volume of demand generated. </s></p><p n="p11.61"><s n="s1.4;p11.61">Canada is one of the wealthiest countries in the world. </s><s n="s2.4;p11.61">In 2004, consumer spending increased by 3,4%, and disposable income by 1,7%, expected to rise again with 2,5% in 2005 (<seg type="URL" n="www.statcan.ca"/>). </s><s n="s3.4;p11.61">This shows that the domestic market in Canada is in a good economic position, affecting the demand for hospitality services positively. </s><s n="s4.4;p11.61">However, as mentioned earlier, high oil prices in the future will have the opposite effect (Tal, 2004). </s></p><p n="p12.61"><s n="s1.5;p12.61">Middleton and Clarke (2001) argues that a higher level of education leads to more travel. </s><s n="s2.5;p12.61">In terms of government spending on education, Canada ranks second among the G7 countries, and more than 50% of the population are undertaking higher education (<seg type="URL" n="www.eiu.com"/>), meaning that demand for travel is high. </s><s n="s3.5;p12.61">They also state that people in largeer cities have a higher demand than those living in rural areas. </s><s n="s4.5;p12.61">This is positive for tourism demand in Canada, where almost 50% of the population are living in the 6 largest cities, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton respectively (<seg type="URL" n="www.citypopulation.de"/>). </s><s n="s5.5;p12.61">In total, 77% of the Canadians are located in urban areas (<seg type="URL" n="www.icongroupedition.com"/>). </s></p><p n="p13.61"><s n="s1.6;p13.61">Demand is also strongly affected by holiday entitlement. </s><s n="s2.6;p13.61">Canadian people have only 2 weeks paid vacation plus 12 paid holidays during a year. </s><s n="s3.6;p13.61">In the largest international market, the US, paid vacations are not required, and there are 10 paid holidays (Kjeldberg <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2005). </s><s n="s4.6;p13.61">This means that tourism demand are weakened, and that other international markets could provide a higher demand. </s><s n="s5.6;p13.61">However, Goeldner (in Kandampully, 2000) indicates that technology factors will dramatically alter the tourism demand in the future. </s><s n="s6.6;p13.61">Demand in Canada and the US is therefore significantly boosted by the strong development of mass media, information technology such as the internet, as well as the excellent infrastructure (<seg type="URL" n="www.cia.gov"/>). </s></p><p n="p14.61"><s n="s1.5;p14.61">To establish demand in Canada, Perfection Hotels also developed a tourist area life cycle (TALC), indication which stage Canada as a tourist destination belong to (Appendix 1, Figure 1). </s><s n="s2.5;p14.61">Based on this, Canada is on a consolidation stage, where the rate of tourist arrivals are declining. </s><s n="s3.5;p14.61">However, it should be noted that this decline most likely is a result of negative events such as 9/11, economic slowdown in the US, conflicts in Afghanitstan and Iraq, and two outbreaks of SARS in Canada (Loverseed, 2003). </s><s n="s4.5;p14.61">Also, the decline is in line with the rest of the region, and the Canadian market share has been stable at 15,5% (<seg type="URL" n="www.world-tourism.org"/>). </s><s n="s5.5;p14.61">This suggest that it is a result of worldwide events, instead of Canada dropping in terms of poularity. </s></p><p n="p15.61"><s n="s1.3;p15.61">The factors discussed above clearly shows that there in total is a strong demand for travel and tourism in Canada, espescially in the leisure market. </s><s n="s2.3;p15.61">Middleton and Clarke (2001) argues that although economic variables is supporting growth for leisure travel in special, developed and strong economies also sustain a large amount of business travel. </s><s n="s3.3;p15.61">Thus, demand for domestic business travel in Canada will also be fairly strong. </s></p><p n="p16.61"><s n="s1.5;p16.61">According to Levitt (1983, p.93), the world has become globalised over the last decades, and "the world's needs and desires have been irrevocably homogenized". </s><s n="s2.5;p16.61">This means that the barriers for international travel have decreased, and travel across national borders increased. </s><s n="s3.5;p16.61">Canada's largest international market is without doubt the US, with some demand also provided by the UK market (Table 1). </s><s n="s4.5;p16.61">These two countries are, like Canada, highly developed in terms of important demand factors such as economy and technology (<seg type="URL" n="www.cia.gov"/>). </s><s n="s5.5;p16.61">When expanding their hospitality business to Canada, Perfection Hotels can therefore, in addition to the strong domestic demand, also expect international demand, from the US in particular. </s></p><p n="p17.61"><s n="s1.2;p17.61">Operating in the luxury market sector, a strong and growing national economy is a key factor for the demand for Perfection Hotel's services. </s><s n="s2.2;p17.61">A high level of education, as well as the geographical situation with the greater part of the population living in urban areas and cities, will also be critical sources for demand. </s></p><table id="BAWE_3046a-tab.001"><head><hi

therefore Perfection Hotels must analyse their market sector to gain an understanding of the competitive factors influencing their business. </s><s n="s2.3;p18.61">Porter (1980) argues that the intensity of competition within an industry depends on the total effect of five forces, the bargaining power of customers, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products, and finally the rivalry among competitive firms. </s><s n="s3.3;p18.61">All these factors can be weighted separately and added together to find the total level of competition in the market sector (Appendix 4, Table I). </s></p><p n="p19.61"><s n="s1.5;p19.61">Jayawardena (2003) argues that Canadian tour operators play an essential role in domestic tourism. </s><s n="s2.5;p19.61">This strong role make them quite powerful in the industry, being able to press hotel prices down. </s><s n="s3.5;p19.61">The hotel industry is also well developed in Canada, with several players operating in the market (<seg type="URL" n="www.canadianhotelguide.com"/>). </s><s n="s4.5;p19.61">This gives consumers a great range of choices, increasing their power. </s><s n="s5.5;p19.61">The total bargaining power of customers is therefore, with the strong position of tour operators as the most important factor, quite high. </s></p><p n="p20.61"><s n="s1.6;p20.61">Canada's food and beverage sector has numerous suppliers of food and beverage products (<seg type="URL" n="www.atn-riae.agr.ca"/>). </s><s n="s2.6;p20.61">The competition between the suppliers will push prices down and reduce their power, which is a benefit for the hotel industry. </s><s n="s3.6;p20.61">However, the strenght of union in Canada is very high. </s><s n="s4.6;p20.61">In a research done by Murray (1993) about union structure, Canada was the only country with an overall increase in union membership and union density from 1970-1989. </s><s n="s5.6;p20.61">In addition, Abraham (1997) concludes that Canadian law aid unions in the area of union security. </s><s n="s6.6;p20.61">This strongly increases the power of suppliers, making their total bargaining power in the hotel market quite high. </s></p><p n="p21.61"><s n="s1.3;p21.61">The capital costs, identified as property and dealer network investments, as well as initial promotion expenses by Bowman (1998), of entering the hotel market are clearly quite high (Evans <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., 2003). </s><s n="s2.3;p21.61">This also applies to the Canadian market. </s><s n="s3.3;p21.61">Also, big players such as Four Seasons, Intercontinental, Starwood and Fairmont to name but a few (<seg type="URL" n="www.canadianhotelguide.com"/>) are dominating the market through economies of scale, making the threat of entry for other hotels into the market fairly low. </s></p><p n="p22.61"><s n="s1.3;p22.61">As a result of the many developed information channels such as the internet (<seg type="URL" n="www.cia.gov"/>), combined with the developed Canadian hotel market in all sectors (<seg type="URL" n="www.canadianhotelguide.com"/>), potential hotel guest can easily find substitues for their preferred hotel product. </s><s n="s2.3;p22.61">Staying with family and friends is another substitute product, and especially visitors form the UK can choose this option due to the close family ties to Canadians (Sherwood and Hodgkinson, 2005). </s><s n="s3.3;p22.61">Substitute products are therefore a serious threat in the hotel industry in Canada. </s></p><p n="p23.61"><s n="s1.9;p23.61">According to Haywood (2003), the supply of rooms in the Canadian hotel market has increased steadily from 1998 to 2002, and as a result the total occupancy level has dropped (Appendix 4, Table 2). </s><s n="s2.9;p23.61">This is a signal of intense competition in the market. </s><s n="s3.9;p23.61">The number of hotels operating in all market sectors also indicates a high level of rivalry. </s><s n="s4.9;p23.61">For Perfection Hotels, entering the luxury market, the competitive situation will be a big threat. </s><s n="s5.9;p23.61">Their main competitors is Starwood (through it's Sheraton brand), Marriott (Renaissance brand), Hyatt, and Fairmont, which is north Americas largest luxury hotel company (<seg type="URL" n="www.fairmont.com"/>). </s><s n="s6.9;p23.61">However, the biggest competitor for Perfection Hotels is Four Seasons, which is a Canadian company offering luxury hotels and resorts (<seg type="URL" n="www.fourseasons.com"/>). </s><s n="s7.9;p23.61">All of these players are large, international companies. </s><s n="s8.9;p23.61">A smaller player is Metropolitan Hotels (<seg type="URL" n="www.metropolitan.com"/>). </s><s n="s9.9;p23.61">With three luxury hotels in the Canadian market only,

environment, total demand, and competition makes up the total attractiveness of the Canadian hotel market. </s><s n="s2.4;p24.61">Their business environment is quite similar to the one in the UK, and Canada is political stable and strongly developed in terms of economy and technology. </s><s n="s3.4;p24.61">The country risk in Canada, as Contractor and Kundu (1998) refer to as the degree of environmental (i.e political) uncertainty, is therefore quite low. </s><s n="s4.4;p24.61">Cultural factors are also similar, however, the ethnic diversity of the British and the French parts of the population must be taken into consideration. </s></p><p n="p25.61"><s n="s1.3;p25.61">There is a strong demand for hospitality services in the luxury sector, both in the leisure and the business market. </s><s n="s2.3;p25.61">International demand is high, espescially from the US where culture and levels of economic development are similar to the Canadian market (Alexander, 1996). </s><s n="s3.3;p25.61">However, in the luxury market there is a high level of competition (Appendix 4, Table 1), with a number of well established brands already operating. </s></p><p n="p26.61"><s n="s1.1;p26.61">Overall, the attractiveness of the Canadian hospitality market is very high, as we can see from the attractiveness grid (Appendix 5). </s></p><p n="p27.61"><s n="s1.5;p27.61">Expanding into the Canadian market, Perfection Hotels must choose between the three main market entry modes, full ownership, management contracts or franchising (Gannon and Johnson, 1997). </s><s n="s2.5;p27.61">Felstead (in Connell, 1997, p.215) defines franchising as "a business relationship whereby a franchisor permits a franchisee to use their brand name, product, or system of business in a specified and ongoing manner in return for a fee", while management contracts are "an arrangement under which operational control of an enterprise...is vested by contract in a separate enterprise which performs the necessary menegement functions in return for a fee" (Young <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s3.5;p27.61">in Gannon and Johnson, 1997, p.194). </s><s n="s4.5;p27.61">An ownership, on the other hand, is when a company invest in- and operate a hotel themselves (Contractor and Kundu, 1998), usually achieved through a combination of acquisition and organic growth (Gannon and Johnson, 1997). </s><s n="s5.5;p27.61">Each choice has implications for the speed and cost of entry, as well as risk, flexibility, control, profitability and payback within the target market (Gannon, 1993). </s></p><p n="p28.61"><s n="s1.6;p28.61">Driscoll and Paliwoda (1997) argues that there are four main factors deciding which modal choice to use, these are control, resource commitment, dissemination and flexibility. </s><s n="s2.6;p28.61">Control is the single most important determinant, and a full ownership provides a higher degree of control than management contracts and franschising (Gannon and Johnson, 1997). </s><s n="s3.6;p28.61">However, resource commitments are greater in a full ownership, and assets will incur substantial sunk costs if they are being redeployed (Hill in Herrmann and Datta, 2002). </s><s n="s4.6;p28.61">On the other hand, management contracts will require medium, and franchising low, resource commitments (Driscoll and Paliwoda, 1997). </s><s n="s5.6;p28.61">When it comes to disemmination, both ownership and franchising more or less eliminate it, while management contracts provide a medium-high risk of a business partner being oppurtinistic (Driscoll and Paliwoda, 1997). </s><s n="s6.6;p28.61">Gannon and Johnson (1997) argues that of the three entry modes, franchising are offering the highest degree of flexibility, followed by management contracts. </s></p><p n="p29.61"><s n="s1.5;p29.61">Entering Canada, Perfection Hotels should use either franchise or management contracts, giving them access to a partner's knowledge on markets, competitors, and governmental policies (Herrmann and Datta, 2002) This will be valuable since the hotel group is new to international expansion. </s><s n="s2.5;p29.61">According to Erramilli <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s><s n="s3.5;p29.61">(2002), management contracts are favoured over franchising when a company have capabilities that can not be reproduced by others, when there are qualified local investments in the host market, and when the culture in the host country is similar to home. </s><s n="s4.5;p29.61">On the other hand, Dev <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. </s><s n="s5.5;p29.61">(2002) argues that franchising should be chosen when there is availability of quality management in the host market, and when the business environment is highly developed. </s></p><p n="p30.61"><s n="s1.2;p30.61">In the case of Perfection Hotels, management contracts will be their best modal choice, giving more control over their operations and brand standards than

concentrated, and decisions should to be consistent with the needs of the customers in the specific segments, resources available in the company, the competition in the segment, and the overall business environment. </s><s n="s3.4;p31.61">After segmenting, each segment has to be assessed in terms of attractiveness (Hlavacek and Reddy, 1986), and finally the target markets are selected, a process which is closely linked to the product planning and development (Corey, 1975). </s><s n="s4.4;p31.61">Target market selection is a critical issue, and must be proritised in any company (Simkin and Dibb, 1998). </s></p><p n="p32.61"><s n="s1.3;p32.61">The domestic demand in Canada is high, and between 60% and 70% of total demand for the tourism industry in Canada comes from this market

markets are insignificant, therefore Perfection Hotels should concentrate on the domestic and the US market. </s></p><p n="p34.61"><s n="s1.4;p34.61">The primary target market for Perfection Hotel is the domestic business market, attracting meetings and small conferences in particular. </s><s n="s2.4;p34.61">Shifflet and Bhatia (1998) argues that business customers give more value, and the domestic business and convention market in Canada increased with 15,7% from 2003 to 2004 (Appendix 3, Table II). </s><s n="s3.4;p34.61">This suggest that the potential for profit are good within the

domestic market is a big part of the total market. </s><s n="s2.3;p36.61">Perfection Hotels should therefore target domestic leisure travellers as their tertiary target market, with focus is on realtively small households, where the parents' age are from 45-65, living in urban areas. </s><s n="s3.3;p36.61">They should also have a high income and spending power since leisure travellers tend

perceived value beyond the observable value to differentiate the product (Supphellen, 2000). </s><s n="s6.7;p44.61">Aaker (in Reardon, 2005) stress that since brand equity can provide a higher market share and increase loyalty, the health of the company are dependent on the brand image. </s><s n="s7.7;p44.61">Therefore it must be strongly emphasized by management. </s></p><p n="p45.61"><s

strategies such as house of brands, endorsed brands, sub-brands, and branded house. </s><s n="s3.3;p45.61">However, since Perfection Hotels only has one brand, this is not something that need to be considered at the moment. </s></p><p n="p46.61"><s n="s1.6;p46.61">A brand can in most instances be seen as a promise to the consumers, who expect to receive the values associated with the brand. </s><s n="s2.6;p46.61">However, the nature of the service industry, where the service encounter is a critical part, makes it hard to achieve full consistency in the delivery process (de Chernatony and

reservation centre in London. </s><s n="s3.3;p56.61">Global Distribution Systems (GDS's) is another key distribution channel, and in addition Perfection Hotels should strive to establish a good relationship with major business travel agents. </s></p><p n="p57.61"><s n="s1.3;p57.61">Perfection Hotels pricing strategy should also be standardised, using a cost-plus approach, which is setting prices to cover costs plus a predetermined profit (Harris, 1999). </s><s n="s2.3;p57.61">This will make the prices high, but the target markets are willing to pay a little extra the excellent product Perfection Hotels offer. </s><s n="s3.3;p57.61">However, competitor prices are also taken into consideration and followed closely, and since the prices has been just below the highest price level in

of the population. </s><s n="s6.8;p58.61">This advertising should be delivered through TV-commercials (more emphasized in Quebec), selected magazines, and billboards at major airports in Canada and the US, preferably in business lounges. </s><s n="s7.8;p58.61">Perfection Hotels should also use sales promotion in form of frequent guest award to gain relationships with the guests, increasing the opportunity for repeat business. </s><s n="s8.8;p58.61">Personal selling is the final part of the promotion mix, and should be used to contact the travel representatives for major Canadian and US
