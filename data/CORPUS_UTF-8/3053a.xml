'Japan at Play' and the field of anthropology. </s><s n="s2.5;p1.23">Play in Japan covers many aspects that we (westernised society) may not perceive as play, anime may be one of these. </s><s n="s3.5;p1.23">In anthropological terms it is important not to make assumptions and use definitions cross culturally as many words and terms mean different things, like this area of 'play'. </s><s n="s4.5;p1.23">Anime is the Japanese meaning for animation, and is classed as a passive form of play in this culture. </s><s n="s5.5;p1.23">We may not class it as play, but do classify it as a relaxing activity. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_3053a-pic.001"/><p n="p2.23"><s n="s1.4;p2.23">Anime is a big part of the Japanese culture and ranges from silly ideas to very serious ones, and is not necessarily intended for any specific age group. </s><s n="s2.4;p2.23">It is often related to or a reproduction of Manga (Japanese comic books) which is also a very popular interest in this culture. </s><s n="s3.4;p2.23">Anime stands out from western animation due to its stylized, colorful images and vibrant characters. </s><s n="s4.4;p2.23">(Wikipedia website) (See picture: 'Full Metal Panic' cartoon from <seg type="URL" n="www.chinadaily.com"/>). </s></p><p n="p3.23"><s n="s1.2;p3.23">I am focusing on female characters as Japanese anime has a unique and contrasting way of portraying woman compared to say English or American animation/ films (which I will be discussing). </s><s n="s2.2;p3.23">(Martinez,1998) </s></p><figure id="BAWE_3053a-pic.002"/><p n="p4.23"><s n="s1.1;p4.23">I am going to base the body of the discussion on the film 'Spirited Away' directed by Hayao Miyazaki but will draw on other anime examples also. </s></p><p n="p5.23"><s n="s1.2;p5.23">From personal experience, it is clear that hero's and the strongest characters in western cartoons, action programmes and movies are predominantly played by males. </s><s n="s2.2;p5.23">A few examples may include: Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Popeye, H-man, Bananaman, The A Team, Spiderman, Superman and Batman, just to point out a few!. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_3053a-pic.003"/><figure

n="s2.6;p6.23">They may be saving or fighting for a vulnerable women (ie. </s><s n="s3.6;p6.23">Popeye with Olive, Cinderella and her prince or Superman and Loius Lane), or they might be fighting for their society (i.e Batman and Bananaman), others work in a solely male group or gang (like The A Team). </s><s n="s4.6;p6.23">However in Japanese anime " Women are just as likely to play the Hero as the man" (Levi 1996, p115). </s><s n="s5.6;p6.23">Levi also points out that even if they aren't the 'heroin' or 'strongest' character, they don't tend to blend into the background, which may be seen in western animation. </s><s n="s6.6;p6.23">(Levi, 1996, p116). </s></p><p n="p7.23"><s n="s1.4;p7.23">Even the male Japanese Super heroes aren't the manliest characters. </s><s n="s2.4;p7.23">Tom Gill has picked up on and questioned the masculinity of Japanese 'Ultraman' (America's Superman). </s><s n="s3.4;p7.23">He points out that 'Ultraman' is a good fighter but hasn't got the over the top masculinity of 'Superman'. </s><s n="s4.4;p7.23">Gill has quoted 'Ultraman' as being "sexless and downright feminine" (Martinez, 1998, p35). </s></p><p n="p8.23"><s n="s1.1;p8.23">As you can see in the picture 'Ultraman' doesn't have the large biceps that 'Superman' has, instead he has a feminine figure, no sign of masculine genitalia and maybe even breasts!. </s></p><figure

characters aren't always that masculine. </s><s n="s2.2;p9.23">This leads me onto the female characters used in Japanese anime. </s></p><p n="p10.23"><s n="s1.5;p10.23">I think 'Spirited Away' is a good example to use for analysing female roles as it has a mix of characters and is not by all means a feminist film. </s><s n="s2.5;p10.23">Wrote by Hayao Miyazaki who has become internationally famous for his Manga/Anime creations. </s><s n="s3.5;p10.23">(Rodriguez, 2001). </s><s n="s4.5;p10.23">His film 'Spirited Away' won the Best Animated Feature in 2003, following a huge success of his previous film 'Princess Monoke'. </s><s n="s5.5;p10.23">(National Catholic reporter,2005). </s></p><p n="p11.23"><s n="s1.5;p11.23">The general story of 'Spirited Away' is of a young girl and her

into pigs. </s><s n="s3.5;p11.23">The young girl (Chihiro) must work and make herself useful to survive here with all the spirits, talking animals and hybrids. </s><s n="s4.5;p11.23">She learns to value things and have respect. </s><s n="s5.5;p11.23">The film has a happy ending with her helping others and saving her parents, it is a very enchanting and gripping film. </s></p><p n="p12.23"><s n="s1.10;p12.23">The main character in the film is Chihiro, she is only ten and at the start of the film she seems vulnerable, sad and weak. </s><s n="s2.10;p12.23">She doesn't want to move and sulks in the back of the car, her flowers she is holding get damaged and she sobs some more. </s><s n="s3.10;p12.23">When they get lost at the entrance to the park she is scared and tries to stop her parents from going in, but she is helpless and ignored by her parents. </s><s n="s4.10;p12.23">Chihiro's character soon comes into a different light when her parents turn to pigs. </s><s n="s5.10;p12.23">She sees the spirits emerge and tries to escape until a young boy (Huku) approaches her and warns her she must get a job at the bathhouse and work hard to survive, after this she becomes strong and knows that to save herself and her parents she must be brave. </s><s n="s6.10;p12.23">She finds a job with Yubaba, a mean spirited old women who is in charge of everyone. </s><s

judge people on their appearance. </s><s n="s9.10;p12.23">She doesn't take gold off one the guests- like all the other workers were, and shows there is more to life than tangible products. </s><s n="s10.10;p12.23">She doesn't doubt anyone and helps those that do bad things, and she goes to extremes (even putting her own life at risk) to save others she has grown fond of. </s></p><p n="p13.23"><s n="s1.3;p13.23">All these characteristics create a strong, heroic and brave female character that has been formed from a scared, vulnerable young girl. </s><s n="s2.3;p13.23">It shows that females don't always have to play the roles of the helpless and powerless that need to be rescued by the 'heroic' male. </s><s n="s3.3;p13.23">Mes points out that " Chihiro is the little heroine at the centre of 'Spirited Away'" (<seg type="URL" n="www.midnighteye.com"/>, 2002). </s></p><p n="p14.23"><s n="s1.1;p14.23">The pictures below show Chihiro's change from a sad and vulnerable
