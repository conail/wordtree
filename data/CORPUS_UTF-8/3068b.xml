he signifies the sensitivity and discretion of maturity, whilst Emma represents the vivacity and playfulness of youth. </s><s n="s3.4;p5.9">Together they create a successful partnership, signifying that age and youth can complement each other. </s><s n="s4.4;p5.9">This portrays another aspect of the multifaceted nature of time as a guiding influence in the novel. </s></p><p n="p6.9"><s n="s1.8;p6.9">The character of Frank Churchill challenges the conventionality of time in 'Emma'. </s><s n="s2.8;p6.9">The very fact that he arrives into the story late means that Emma is immediately vexed because he upsets her plans. </s><s n="s3.8;p6.9">He is also an impulsive character, as can be seen when he leaves for London at short notice merely for a haircut. </s><s n="s4.8;p6.9">Emma reflects that 'it did not accord with the rationality of plan'. </s><s n="s5.8;p6.9">The act seems to Emma as irrational and illogical. </s><s n="s6.8;p6.9">Everything for Emma is planned and organised and when something does not agree with these plans, there is immediate discord. </s><s n="s7.8;p6.9">Anything out of place, even time, is worrying for her. </s><s n="s8.8;p6.9">For instance, in chapter 25 when Emma is considering going to the Coles' party, the thought of her father staying up late makes her uneasy: </s></p><quote lang="English"><hi rend="italic">I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time - and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort.</hi> {Chapter 25}</quote><p n="p7.9"><s n="s1.20;p7.9">Time in 'Emma' plays a much different role than in 'The Winter's Tale'. </s><s n="s2.20;p7.9">The precise nature of time reflects the aspect of society which Austen was portraying in the 18th century. </s><s n="s3.20;p7.9">A realistic approach to time is therefore needed for the topic to be considered accurately. </s><s n="s4.20;p7.9">Sir Walter Scott said of Jane Austen that she 'knows intimately and observes precisely' social situations in the early 1800s'. </s><s n="s5.20;p7.9">The author focussed on nuances of society and behaviour in society as well aspects of public and private lives, and therefore needed to apply a structured time frame in order to show the subtleties of interactions and shifts in behaviour accurately. </s><s n="s6.20;p7.9">In 'The Winter's Tale' there is more of a freedom of expression of time and space. </s><s n="s7.20;p7.9">An ambiguous and unrealistic view of time and place lends itself well to the fairytale nature of the story. </s><s n="s8.20;p7.9">Time plays much more of a role in the telling of the story, whereas in 'Emma' it guides and manipulates the telling of the story. </s><s n="s9.20;p7.9">As Keith Sagar states, Time in 'The Winter's Tale' plays a number of roles and is not merely a plot device to move forward the story by sixteen years: 'Time the Destroyer (tragedy) turns his hourglass and becomes Time the Revealer, the Healer, the Restorer and the Begetter (comedy)'.<ref target="BAWE_3068b-ftnote.001"/> 'The Winter's Tale' is an unusual play due to the fact that it cannot be easily categorised into any particular form of play. </s><s n="s10.20;p7.9">Many of Shakespeare's plays can be simplistically identified as either tragedies or comedies. </s><s n="s11.20;p7.9">Tragedies are of a tragic nature - usually with one or more deaths. </s><s n="s12.20;p7.9">'Romeo and Juliet' is an example of a tragedy. </s><s n="s13.20;p7.9">Whilst a comedy is not often overtly funny, it usually has a happy ending involving marriage or reunion. </s><s n="s14.20;p7.9">'As You Like It' is an example of a comedy. </s><s n="s15.20;p7.9">'The Winter's Tale' however has both tragic and comic elements. </s><s n="s16.20;p7.9">Time plays an important role in distinguishing whether the play ends comically or tragically. </s><s n="s17.20;p7.9">In some of Shakespeare's plays where there are both comic and tragic elements, there can often be one line which can signal the difference between the play ending happily or otherwise. </s><s n="s18.20;p7.9">In 'Much Ado About Nothing' it is the line uttered by Beatrice; 'Kill Claudio'<ref target="BAWE_3068b-ftnote.002"/> which almost leads to tragic consequences. </s><s n="s19.20;p7.9">In 'The Winter's Tale', it is the famous stage direction 'Exit, pursued by a bear' which switches the play from a tragedy to a comedy. </s><s n="s20.20;p7.9">At the start of Act IV, however, the entrance of Time also signals a visible shift in mood. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_3068b-ftnote.001"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.2;pn1.1">Sagar, K. </s><s n="s2.2;pn1.1"><hi rend="italic">The Winter's Tale</hi>, 2001, <seg type="URL" n="www.keithsagar.co.uk"/> </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_3068b-ftnote.002"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">{Act IV sc1. line285} </s></p></note><quote lang="English"><hi rend="italic">Now take upon me, in the name of Time,</hi> <hi rend="italic">To use my wings impute it not a crime</hi> <hi rend="italic">To me or my swift passage, that I slide</hi> <hi rend="italic"> O'er sixteen years...</hi> {Act IV, sc.1, lines3-6}</quote><p n="p8.9"><s n="s1.6;p8.9">From this moment onwards there are comic elements which hint at a happy finale. </s><s n="s2.6;p8.9">We are introduced to Polyxenes' son, Florizel and also a grown Perdita suggesting a possible union. </s><s n="s3.6;p8.9">There is also comic dialogue between a Shepherd and his son. </s><s n="s4.6;p8.9">In all literary forms, time is an important device in exploring the themes of life. </s><s n="s5.6;p8.9">Time is a topic which has fascinated philosophers, writers and artists, as well as the public, for centuries. </s><s n="s6.6;p8.9">A good example of how time is ubiquitous is Andrew Marvell's poem 'To His Coy Mistress'. </s></p><quote lang="English"><hi rend="italic">But at my back I always hear</hi> <hi rend="italic">Time's winged chariot hurrying near</hi></quote><p n="p9.9"><s n="s1.11;p9.9">Time is triumphant in every aspect of life, although it is portrayed differently in certain circumstances and different literary forms. </s><s n="s2.11;p9.9">It is a structural device in 'Emma' which enhances the regimented nature of the novel and is used to highlight Austen's observations of the subtleties of society. </s><s n="s3.11;p9.9">In 'The Winter's Tale' time is undetermined. </s><s n="s4.11;p9.9">The play is not concerned with realism as it runs along the classic fairytale arrangement of 'once upon a time...' </s><s n="s5.11;p9.9">The personification of time therefore complements this form because sixteen years need to pass in order for the story and the situation to right itself. </s><s n="s6.11;p9.9">Time becomes a healer. </s><s n="s7.11;p9.9">Although the play is not based in realism, we, as an audience accept it, because with drama we suspend our usual boundaries of realism. </s><s n="s8.11;p9.9">Time becomes the narrator whilst assuring us that there will be a happy finale, therefore bringing together the play as a whole. </s><s n="s9.11;p9.9">Time in both texts helps the author to explore themes which affect everyday life. </s><s n="s10.11;p9.9">Austen explores more precise themes of behaviour and society, whilst Shakespeare explores the grander themes of life - love and death. </s><s n="s11.11;p9.9">Time is the guiding force for the telling and exploration of these themes, whilst remaining an ever-influential backdrop to the characters' lives and our perception of them. </s></p></div1></body><back/></text></TEI.2>
