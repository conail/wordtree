I told him straightaway that everything I would need would fit in a box - my secret and magic box. His lively bursts of laughter, the glimmer in my relatives' eyes, the twinkling of a star, the pure blue of the sky, a drop of an Alps spring water, the warmth of a fire in the hearth, the genuine smile of a child opening presents, and the sweet lips of my beloved. Tonight, my soul is conversing with the agitated sea which, under this russet sunset, meets rocks and algae. Under these tears of love, my soul is drowning and the salty tears are slowly reaching my heart. It is quite cold outside. And I've taken out this ice from my bosom already blackened by blood. I've placed this ruin in a round-shaped box, the colour of which was indistinct - Time had worn out the emerald-green into a scaled green. And I've locked the box up. This golden key, this Ariadne's thread, leading to my heart, to my soul, I've thrown it away into the sea. This very night, the sun was downing in my heart, never to rise again.</quote><p n="p5.8"><s n="s1.2;p5.8">As suggested in my previous conclusion, magic, i.e. great imagination making you fly above reality so to speak, lies in Poetry. </s><s n="s2.2;p5.8">My own response is 'poetic' in the sense that it is a creation, using and playing with language as a magic tool. </s></p><p n="p6.8"><s n="s1.7;p6.8">My text mainly shares one common point with the previous one - the action of putting things in a very particular box. </s><s n="s2.7;p6.8">The way it is built is actually interesting because, in the first poem, the elements may be symbolic, even more so since they are emphasized thanks to a ternary rhythm (line 17). </s><s n="s3.7;p6.8">We can only venture guesses: gold for preciousness, steel for strength and nobody will ever be able to force the box? </s><s n="s4.7;p6.8">As for the second treasure chest<ref target="BAWE_3071a-ftnote.007"/>, the stress is laid on the colour - green. </s><s n="s5.7;p6.8">It commonly stands for Hope.<ref target="BAWE_3071a-ftnote.008"/> Yet, the shape is as important because the circle is the figure of harmony. </s><s n="s6.7;p6.8">Furthermore, the atmosphere of the whole second part is 'poetic' and 'magic' owing to the sounds: throughout the first sentence, for instance, there is a mix of alliterations on the dentals /d/ and /t/ and on the fricative /s/ along with the assonance on /i/. </s><s n="s7.7;p6.8">The confusion of the elements is also poetic: the water of the sea becomes the tears; the sentence standing on its own can refer to the weather outside but also implicitly refers to the inner feelings of the poet; the poet is dealing with abstractions that have turned concrete through language. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_3071a-ftnote.007"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1"><hi rend="italic">chest</hi> being understood in two senses... </s></p></note><note place="foot" id="BAWE_3071a-ftnote.008"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">the 'quality' that has remained after Pandora opening the box, in the Greek myth </s></p></note><p n="p7.8"><s n="s1.4;p7.8">Let's eventually point out that the reader witnesses two different kinds of dialogue, that are in sharp contrast with the committed tone of the declaration of Wright's poem, where no real addressee can be found. </s><s n="s2.4;p7.8">First, there is a reconstituted conversation between the poet and his closest friend: the question is given directly, having been rephrased (hence, the change of pronouns). </s><s n="s3.4;p7.8">The response could have been given in many ways and I have chosen to make a simple list<ref target="BAWE_3071a-ftnote.009"/>. </s><s n="s4.4;p7.8">As for the second dialogue, as specified by the verb "converse", it happens between the poet and the natural elements. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_3071a-ftnote.009"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">the first four tercets of "The Magic Box" are a mere list, after all </s></p></note><p n="p8.8"><s n="s1.1;p8.8">This piece of writing therefore establishes a dialogue between itself and the reader, who will go back and forth, inferring from the text, understanding it and creating his own world through the magic of words. </s></p></div1></body><back/></text></TEI.2>
