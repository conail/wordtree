there is a call and response chant between the harvester and the assembled crowd, many of whom will have run into the village to witness the event. </s><s n="s11.12;p5.8">At various stages throughout the festivities the yams are placed in piles of a specific size and shape. </s><s n="s12.12;p5.8">There is much dancing throughout the period during which the men wear elaborate headdresses made from feathers, or carry shields. </s></p><p n="p6.8"><s n="s1.10;p6.8">Arguably, many so called 'world religions' also celebrate the bringing in of crops, for instance many Christian churches in Britain hold a harvest festival, sometimes inviting members of the church to bring food to be donated to the needy. </s><s n="s2.10;p6.8">These festivities invariably involve an element of retrospection; thanks for the good harvest and abundance of food, and prayers for the harvests to come. </s><s n="s3.10;p6.8">The Trobriand islanders, according to Malinowski, involve no element of thanks in their proceedings. </s><s n="s4.10;p6.8">Upon seeing this spectacle for the first time, one would have a hard time placing it within the realm of religion. </s><s n="s5.10;p6.8">In fact to a casual observer the proceedings may appear to be a series of pointless exercises; the piling of the harvested yams, the display of the crop. </s><s n="s6.10;p6.8">Surely the food is there to be eaten? </s><s n="s7.10;p6.8">This only goes to demonstrate that our perception of religion can be clouded by classification. </s><s n="s8.10;p6.8">These rituals may not fit into our typical idea of how a religious practice should appear, but there is no doubt that they are part of the Trobriand Islanders religion; the yams are displayed to please spirits of the dead. </s><s n="s9.10;p6.8">Here we can see a similarity with Christianity; the purpose is to gratify a higher power, no matter that one is a singular god and one is the spirits of dead ancestors. </s><s n="s10.10;p6.8">At first glance we may have dismissed the actions of the Trobriand Islanders as non-religious but in fact they are deeply rooted in strongly held religious beliefs. </s></p><p n="p7.8"><s n="s1.6;p7.8">Moving on from classification, methods of research themselves are discussed in Robert Shanafelt's 2004 article 'Magic, miracles, and marvels in anthropology'. </s><s n="s2.6;p7.8">In reponse to rising interest in witchcraft and magic as alternative religions, the article discusses how we should enter into research about these topics without any preconceived ideas or elements of doubt in our minds because this can only serve to hinder research. </s><s n="s3.6;p7.8">He states how whilst a questioning mind is obviously imperative to insightful research, the mind should be open to all suggestion as one only classes things as 'impossible' or 'miraculous' because they do not fit into our current Western belief system; that is, science. </s><s n="s4.6;p7.8">This viewpoint is supported by Frazer, who suggested that there have been ages of both magic and religion and that we are currently in an age of science. </s><s n="s5.6;p7.8">Science, like any other belief system, is only one possible explanation of the world around us,could well be superseded by another series of beliefs in years to come. </s><s n="s6.6;p7.8">Therefore, dismissive treatment of others' religious beliefs or practices is entirely unfounded as we are judging it from our own cultural values which are not only moulded by our social setting but also by the belief system which makes the basis of our culture, and we should realise that this is, perhaps, one of many. </s></p><p n="p8.8"><s n="s1.2;p8.8">Religion is a difficult subject area to study as we need the term as a starting point for any research, but the concept itself can hinder study. </s><s n="s2.2;p8.8">Definitions of religion will keep being revised for years to come, and it is doubtful if ever there will be a definitive one with no exceptions because not only is each person's definition rooted in the culture of their upbringing, new religions are formed every day, and we can be certain that many of these do not fit the pattern we are accustomed to. </s></p></div1></body><back/></text></TEI.2>
