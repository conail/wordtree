Tracy focusing on the thriller aspect, whereas 'The Da Vinci Code' by Dan Brown is primarily about the detective work. </s><s n="s3.3;p1.10">However, there are many titles with a degree of humour and light heartedness, such as books by Alexander McCall Smith. </s></p><p n="p2.10"><s n="s1.12;p2.10">My novel, 'Straight to the Heart' is aimed at men, between the ages of 25-45, and will hopefully attract a broader range of person. </s><s n="s2.12;p2.10">The title relates to the vein that runs from the wedding ring finger to the heart. </s><s n="s3.12;p2.10">This is relevant as severed ring fingers are delivered to the protagonist. </s><s n="s4.12;p2.10">However, it also relates to the common phrase "straight from the heart" indicating that the crimes committed are ones of passion. </s><s n="s5.12;p2.10">The style is appropriate for this target audience, as it is informal and has an edge of humour. </s><s n="s6.12;p2.10">It also addresses issues that the target audience will be concerned with. </s><s n="s7.12;p2.10">My novel has aspects of both thriller and detective novels, using a detective as a protagonist investigating the crime. </s><s n="s8.12;p2.10">This is similar to work by James Patterson and Ian Rankin. </s><s n="s9.12;p2.10">The thriller aspect is introduced into the novel through the actual murders. </s><s n="s10.12;p2.10">Therefore, men would be interested in both the thriller of the crimes, but could also relate to the life of the protagonist. </s><s n="s11.12;p2.10">The style and target audience is synonymous to that of Christopher Brookmyre's, and therefore will offer an alternative for fans of Brookmyre. </s><s n="s12.12;p2.10">As a woman, I will be using my first initial only, as men may be less inclined to buy a book by a female author. </s></p><p n="p3.10"><s n="s1.5;p3.10">I have chosen Abacus, an imprint of the Little, Brown Book Group, to publish my novel, as they have a list of impressive authors from many genres, such as Iain M.
