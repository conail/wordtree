Most important of the provisions are under sections 13 and 14 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 as amended by the Sale of Goods (Amendments) Act 1994 (and the equivalent sections 8 and 9 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982). " [5]</quote><quote lang="English">"Section 13 states that the goods supplied must correspond with their description. If a computer system has a description that it will "perform X number of functions per second" or that the software complies with specified standards, the supplier will be in breach of this implied term if the system or software is not as described. " [5]</quote><quote lang="English">"Section 14 states that the goods must be of satisfactory quality and that they are reasonably fit for the buyer's purpose. The second limb of this implied term operates where the buyer expressly or by implication makes known to the supplier any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought (whether or not that purpose is one for which the goods are commonly supplied). In many circumstances, such as in the supply of safety-critical systems, the purpose arises by implication. In circumstances where it would be unreasonable for the buyer to rely on the skill and judgement of the seller, or he did not in fact rely on the seller's skill, then this term is not implied. In the safety-related field it is also likely that a particular purpose will be expressly stated. " [5]</quote><quote lang="English">"Certain clauses ('exclusion clauses') are commonly relied on to exclude or restrict the liability of a party arising through the failure to perform a contract. The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 limits this ability to exclude or restrict liability in certain contracts. In particular, it is never possible to exclude or restrict liability in negligence, or in relation to failure to take reasonable care in the performance of a contract, for personal injury or death by reference to any contract term . " [5]</quote><quote lang="English">"The legislation places the burden of proof on the defendant and so it is for the producer to prove that it is impossible to discover the defect. From a practical point of view, manufacturers and suppliers of computer hardware and software must take notice of (and comply with) those standards which do exist in the computer industry. Similarly, manufacturers should ensure that adequate verification and validation procedures in the production of software are followed. They should also take note of any other procedures and draft standards generally followed by cautious manufacturers. Such actions would be seen as evidence in support of this defence, although would not necessarily absolve the defendant from liability. " [5]</quote><p n="p67.69"/></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Tort</head><quote lang="English">"A contract sets the parameters of liability, and the rules of privity (ie. only a party to the contract is able to sue) limit the persons who can claim for loss or damage under a contract. Where, however, a duty of care can be established between a person who has manufactured or supplied a product and the person injured then this injured party may be able to sue in tort for the negligence of the manufacturer or supplier. Tort means simply a legal "wrong" and more particularly a civil wrong as opposed to a criminal offence. " [5]</quote><quote lang="English">"For a duty of care to exist it must be reasonably foreseeable that in the absence of reasonable care in the preparation of a product the consumer (or the innocent by-stander) may suffer injury to his (or her) life or property. This duty will occur when the product is intended to reach the ultimate consumer in the state in which it left the manufacturer. In practice, it is not usually difficult to find one or more persons who owe a duty of care in the circumstances of the supply of a safety-critical system. " [5]</quote><p n="p68.69"/></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Consumer Protection Act</head><quote lang="English">"Only damage of a specific type may form the basis of an action under the Consumer Protection Act. The damage may be death, personal injury or damage to property. However, only property which is of a type ordinarily intended for private use may be the subject of a claim and property damage must exceed £275. Therefore, if a chemical plant was to explode because of a faulty computer control system the damage to any surrounding office buildings or to the chemical plant itself could not be the subject of a claim under the Act. Office buildings are not ordinarily intended for private use. However, if the homes or possessions of nearby individuals were also damaged, liability to pay compensation would arise for the damage to those houses and possessions under the Consumer Protection Act. " [5]</quote><quote lang="English">"A plaintiff who brings an action under the Consumer Protection Act must show that, as a result of the defect in the product, it was reasonably foreseeable that an injury of the type suffered would occur. This is unlikely to be difficult in the context of a safety-critical system: if it is not safe, it is reasonably foreseeable that persons will be injured and property damaged as a result. " [5]</quote><quote lang="English">"The practical scope for a manufacturer or supplier to exclude or restrict his liability under the Consumer Protection Act is very limited.
