individual violence, on moral and pragmatic grounds. </s><s n="s2.7;p1.46">This paper discusses some of the criticisms that have been made against anti-war pacifism by its main philosophical rival, the just war theory, paying particular attention to the works of Michael Walzer and John Rawls. </s><s n="s3.7;p1.46">There is a discussion regarding whether the legitimate right of self-defence held by individuals can be extended to political communities, and an attempt to refute this extension is made. </s><s n="s4.7;p1.46">The argument then moves to humanitarian interventions, with the just war theorist claiming that there is a moral basis for supporting military action in countries that fail to adhere to human rights norms. </s><s n="s5.7;p1.46">The anti-war pacifist responds by claiming that violent intervention is inappropriate in cases of human rights violations and that there is a lack of legitimate authority in the international arena. </s><s n="s6.7;p1.46">There follows an outline of some of the positive alternatives that anti-war pacifism has to offer and how non-violent resistance can offer benefits which war cannot. </s><s n="s7.7;p1.46">The essay concludes with a brief sketch of what has been argued thus far and an argument against the current presumption society has in favour of war. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined bold">Introduction</head><p n="p2.46"><s n="s1.16;p2.46">This aim of this essay is to construct a defence of pacifism against some of the criticisms levied by the currently dominant philosophical theory of the just war, focussing largely on the theories of Michael Walzer and John Rawls, two of the major players in contemporary just war theory. </s><s n="s2.16;p2.46">The first thing to do then must be to clarify the meaning of this often misunderstood term, or more precisely, what is meant by it in the context of this essay. </s><s n="s3.16;p2.46">Cyril Wright and Tony Augarde describe pacifism as "a working hypothesis rather than a fixed creed" (Wright and Augarde 1990: 9), and it is essential to understand the wide variety of positions that can be labelled pacifist. </s><s n="s4.16;p2.46">There are anti-war pacifists, vocational pacifists (such as priests), non-violent pacifists, utopian pacifists and many, many more besides. </s><s n="s5.16;p2.46">What unifies this eclectic group is the rejection of war, although the scope and the justification for this rejection may vary widely. </s><s n="s6.16;p2.46">Duane Cady envisages pacifism as lying upon a spectrum that runs from extreme "warism" at one end to absolute pacifism at the other (Cady 1989). </s><s n="s7.16;p2.46">Political realism, the doctrine that proposes war to be a fact of nature and an activity impervious to moral examination, occupies the extreme position of the warist end of the scale. </s><s n="s8.16;p2.46">Various forms of just war theory lie closer to the centre, ranging from those which analyse the moral constraints of war with the briefest of glances to those which are virtually indistinguishable from pacifism. </s><s n="s9.16;p2.46">The key point I wish to make here is that there is a correlation between the position a certain theory occupies on the spectrum and the metaphysical assumptions that lie beneath that theory. </s><s n="s10.16;p2.46">The absolute pacifist maintains that no act of violence can ever be justified, whatever the consequences. </s><s n="s11.16;p2.46">The absolute warist, by comparison, pays no heed whatsoever to moral guidelines- his only focus is upon what practical end a given war may achieve. </s><s n="s12.16;p2.46">The less extreme a pacifist theory becomes, the less deontological the focus is and, conversely, the less extreme a warist theory becomes, the more deontological constraints are recognised, for instance a ban on harming civilians. </s><s n="s13.16;p2.46">The just war theorist and the pacifist differ over the issue of whether the means of war ever justify the ends. </s><s n="s14.16;p2.46">War is not good in itself, and therefore the just war theorist must argue that there is some positive end that justifies the use of violence. </s><s n="s15.16;p2.46">The pacifist, on the other hand, maintains that one cannot make a distinction between means and ends in this way. </s><s n="s16.16;p2.46">The central features of the moral life, such as honesty, justice, refraining from killing and so on are valued </s></p><quote lang="English">not because they are mere means to some end or because they are required by some absolute principle(s) without consideration of their likely effects, but because they constitute the activity of a moral life, good in themselves, expressions of respect for kindred humans, as well as likely to be productive of good results. (Cady 1989: 43)</quote><p n="p3.46"><s n="s1.4;p3.46">There appears to be a fundamental inconsistency in the just warist's attempt to separate means and ends in such a way as to justify the use of violence to achieve a peaceful goal. </s><s n="s2.4;p3.46">It would be absurd to say that cheating is sometimes required for the sake of honesty, or that truth can follow from lying. </s><s n="s3.4;p3.46">When it comes to discussions about war, however, this inconsistency is ignored and it is considered reasonable to argue that war is sometimes the only way of achieving peace. </s><s n="s4.4;p3.46">This point about means and ends has been made early on because the split between pacifism and warism can largely be seen to rest upon the respective position each side takes. </s></p><p n="p4.46"><s n="s1.2;p4.46">In this essay I will attempt to defend a secular version of what James Sterba (1992) has termed "anti-war" pacifism, and which most contemporary pacifists favour in one form or another. </s><s n="s2.2;p4.46">This is to be distinguished from two rather more extreme positions on the pacifist spectrum- non-violent pacifism and non-lethal pacifism. </s></p><div2><head rend="bold">Non-violent pacifism</head><p n="p5.46"><s n="s1.4;p5.46">This is often espoused by vocational pacifists, such as Buddhist monks, and involves a total prohibition of violence against another human being. </s><s n="s2.4;p5.46">As a philosophical position, it would be very difficult to defend non-violent pacifism. </s><s n="s3.4;p5.46">To deny the right to defend oneself seems to deny the existence of rights altogether for, to paraphrase Jan Narveson, the notion of rights would be unintelligible if there were no right to defend them against possible violations (Narveson 1970). </s><s n="s4.4;p5.46">Although Narveson's argument that non-violent pacifism is an internally inconsistent set of beliefs may be contentious<ref target="BAWE_3098b-ftnote.001"/>, it does seem as if this most absolute form does conflict with our most basic assumption about the nature of human rights. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_3098b-ftnote.001"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Jenny

with a prohibition on killing that aggressor. </s><s n="s2.5;p6.46">Although most cases of individual self-defence will not necessarily require the death of one's attacker, there could plausibly be a situation where it comes down to a choice between the aggressor's life and one's own. </s><s n="s3.5;p6.46">In this case non-lethal pacifism seems to suggest that it would be immoral to choose one's own life over that of the aggressor, no matter how unjust the assault. </s><s n="s4.5;p6.46">But surely the defender has more right to kill (in self-defense) than does the assailant (as an unjust act) in this situation. </s><s n="s5.5;p6.46">It could be argued that because of his committing of an unjust aggression, the rights of the attacker can be overridden, or that his death is the lesser of two evils. </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="bold">Anti-war pacifism</head><p n="p7.46"><s n="s1.5;p7.46">Thus we arrive at a philosophical position that allows individual self-defence, even if that

indiscriminate nature of violence in war, especially modern war. </s><s n="s3.5;p7.46">The argument can be summarised as a claim that however carefully war is fought, there are bound to be illegitimate casualties, and even those individuals who are supposed by traditional just war theory to be legitimate targets may turn out not to be so. </s><s n="s4.5;p7.46">This, along with the claim that non-belligerent means of solving conflict are rarely, if ever, undertaken to their full extent. </s><s n="s5.5;p7.46">It is this conception of pacifism that I will attempt to defend against

n="s7.10;p37.46">The invader always has the option of importing workers and officials of its own, but this is a mammoth undertaking and is most likely to fail. </s><s n="s8.10;p37.46">What is more, the non-cooperation of the citizens of an occupied country can have disastrous effects on the morale of the invading army. </s><s n="s9.10;p37.46">Soldiers are trained to fight and to achieve victory quickly and efficiently, but what can they do against peaceful protesters who refuse to engage them in combat? </s><s n="s10.10;p37.46">It is easy to persuade soldiers to shoot those who are shooting back, but the injustice of the shooting of unarmed, pacific civilians is much more obvious and bound to stimulate the moral conscience. </s></p><p n="p38.46"><s n="s1.21;p38.46">The just war theorist can make two objections here. </s><s n="s2.21;p38.46">Firstly, there is little evidence in history of successful non-violent opposition to unjust aggression, and secondly, even if civilian resistance has been successful on occasion, it is only because the aggressor has fought with the rules of war in mind. </s><s n="s3.21;p38.46">To the claim that non-violent resistance is poorly represented in history the anti-war pacifist can point to obvious examples such as Gandhi's struggle against British occupation in India and the civil rights movement in America. </s><s n="s4.21;p38.46">Although the latter is not an example of foreign occupation, it does serve to demonstrate what can be accomplished by peaceful means against an enemy that is stronger and willing to use violence. </s><s n="s5.21;p38.46">The fact that the clear-cut expulsion of an aggressive invading force by non-violent means is a very rare occurrence can be put down to the overwhelming belief held by governments that this form of defence is inadequate. </s><s n="s6.21;p38.46">There has never been a systematic attempt to implement civilian resistance as policy in any country. </s><s n="s7.21;p38.46">All the examples from history have been relatively spontaneous, unorganised affairs but the success of some of these efforts suggests that non-violence could be a highly effective tool with the commitment of but a fraction of the planning and resources which go towards military endeavours. </s><s n="s8.21;p38.46">The second point that the just warist makes is that non-violent resistance can only work against those aggressors who pay heed to the moral prohibition against killing unarmed civilians. </s><s n="s9.21;p38.46">History, it is claimed, is littered with examples of tyrannical conquerors who would employ any means within their power to subdue an occupied population, whether that be death squads, mass rape or concentration camps. </s><s n="s10.21;p38.46">As Michael Walzer puts it, resistance under such conditions would be "a matter of individual heroism or of the heroism of small groups, but not of collective struggle" (Walzer 1992: 332). </s><s n="s11.21;p38.46">Two examples are often cited in support of this point; that of the British in India and that of the Nazis. </s><s n="s12.21;p38.46">The British only capitulated to Ghandi's demands, it is claimed, because of their moral character and restraint in using violence to rule their empire. </s><s n="s13.21;p38.46">This ignores the fact that in April 1919 the British army massacred 379 of Ghandi's supporters and wounded a further 1,137 at Amritsar. </s><s n="s14.21;p38.46">This was not a response to a violent uprising, but an unprovoked assault on a peaceful gathering of people. </s><s n="s15.21;p38.46">The British Empire was the dominant force in the world for hundreds of years only because violence was often used to subdue populations. </s><s n="s16.21;p38.46">The second example that all warists leap upon is that of the Nazis. </s><s n="s17.21;p38.46">It is widely held that any attempt at non-violent resistance would have failed against Hitler because of the utter brutality of his regime and its will to conquer by any means necessary. </s><s n="s18.21;p38.46">However, there are examples of at least partially successful, spontaneous civilian resistance. </s><s n="s19.21;p38.46">In Norway, in 1942, 98% of the countries teachers refused to sign up to the Nazi union, resulting in the closure of many schools and 1,000 of them being sent to concentration camps where some died. </s><s n="s20.21;p38.46">Not one gave in and eight months after the protest began the Norwegian fascist leader Vidkun Quisling was forced to reopen all the schools and reinstate the non-cooperative teachers. </s><s n="s21.21;p38.46">The key point about this example is that it was a spontaneous reaction to Nazi occupation, conducted with little planning or knowledge of the principles of non-violent resistance, and it worked against the most unforgiving and intolerant of enemies. </s></p><p n="p39.46"><s n="s1.13;p39.46">The advantages of a systematic policy of non-violent defence over war are obvious. </s><s n="s2.13;p39.46">An aggressor is more likely to use violence against the victims of an invasion who put up a violent defence than those who resist by purely peaceful means<ref target="BAWE_3098b-ftnote.009"/>. </s><s n="s3.13;p39.46">The moral burden is upon the unjust aggressor in any war, but if the defender refuses to fight this moral burden becomes even greater. </s><s n="s4.13;p39.46">Morality besides, the practical reality is that no army will bother to use violence if it can gain entry to another country without a fight. </s><s n="s5.13;p39.46">This refusal to take up arms appears an awful lot like surrender, but this is not the case. </s><s n="s6.13;p39.46">We have determined that it would be legitimate for individuals to respond to acts of life-threatening violence with acts of violence of their own. </s><s n="s7.13;p39.46">It is mass violence that is prohibited. </s><s n="s8.13;p39.46">The collectivised defence can only begin once an invader is inside the country. </s><s n="s9.13;p39.46">This is when the tactics I outlined above can begin to be employed, and if they have been well planned there are great chances of success. </s><s n="s10.13;p39.46">Another benefit of a policy of non-violent resistance is that there is a lowered chance of being invaded in the first place. </s><s n="s11.13;p39.46">A country without a military is of no threat to any of its neighbours, therefore ruling out pre-emptive strikes and the like. </s><s n="s12.13;p39.46">The main drive for war in modern times is economic gain. </s><s n="s13.13;p39.46">If a country makes clear that its industries and infrastructure will shut down in the event of occupation, it will be a much less appetising target for aggressors. </s></p><note

large number of people can be harnessed anything is possible. </s><s n="s5.12;p40.46">The potential power non-violent resistance possess is far greater than that of soldiers and guns. </s><s

highlight the injustices committed against them and make the truth unbearably obvious to their oppressors. </s></p><p n="p41.46"><s n="s1.16;p41.46">We now come to the second part of the anti-war pacifist's argument regarding alternatives to violent conflict. </s><s n="s2.16;p41.46">The just war theorist claims to desire the abolition of war at some point in the future but maintains that there is a necessity for war in our present situation. </s><s n="s3.16;p41.46">Again we return to the debate regarding means and ends, the pacifist arguing that the inseparable nature of the two means that while we support war in any form there is little or no chance of a real global peace. </s><s n="s4.16;p41.46">What is needed is a refocusing of resources and energy away from the preparation to fight wars and towards efforts to prevent them from occurring in the first place. </s><s n="s5.16;p41.46">The causes of war are complex, although we can cite economic and political power imbalances as being major factors. </s><s n="s6.16;p41.46">Some political realists argue that the use of violence to solve conflicts is a basic fact of human nature and therefore any effort to ban war is a hopeless utopian dream. </s><s n="s7.16;p41.46">The questions surrounding what is and what is not in human nature are at best undecided, but the anti-war pacifist is not aiming at some version of heaven on earth. </s><s n="s8.16;p41.46">There will always be conflict in human society, but one point can be made and that is that our extraordinary evolutionary success as a species has depended largely upon our ability to communicate and cooperate. </s><s n="s9.16;p41.46">Perverted notions of nationality, religion and a cultural propensity to choose war over compromise and understanding can obscure this ability. </s><s n="s10.16;p41.46">However, through education and the construction of global and local institutions, the potential to understand other's interests and to find peaceful solutions to quarrels can become reality. </s><s n="s11.16;p41.46">As Duane Cady points out, "many non-violent behavior patterns are regular features of modern society" (Cady 1989: 80) but on the international stage "fear, competition and dogmatic political and religious ideologies exaggerate differences and exacerbate tensions" (Cady 1989: 82). </s><s n="s12.16;p41.46">There is a hierarchy of commitments in human society, ranging from the family, to the nation-state to the global community. </s><s n="s13.16;p41.46">What is needed is for a change in perception, so we stop seeing our immediate community

</s><s n="s2.6;p42.46">Pacifism has been much derided and ignored as a philosophical position, but it has been shown that there is a rational basis for considering it as a real alternative to just war theory. </s><s n="s3.6;p42.46">In our society there is an overwhelming presumption in favour of warism. </s><s n="s4.6;p42.46">War is touted as the only solution to many international problems and this leads to the neglect of more constructive, morally worthy options. </s><s n="s5.6;p42.46">Even within anti-war movements themselves, the question normally asked is whether or not the war in question is justifiable. </s><s n="s6.6;p42.46">There is a severe lack of debate regarding the question of whether or not <hi rend="italic">war itself</hi> is a justifiable activity. </s></p><p n="p43.46"><s n="s1.10;p43.46">We have shown that the arguments levelled against pacifism are inadequate and fail to provide a moral basis for war. </s><s n="s2.10;p43.46">There is no such moral basis, but war is the easiest way to solve disputes- as Salvor Hardin says in Isaac Asimov's novel <hi rend="italic">Foundation</hi>, "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent" (Asimov, 1953: 71). </s><s n="s3.10;p43.46">Just war theory and pacifism both stem from early Christianity, the former largely replacing the latter due to reasons of political expediency. </s><s n="s4.10;p43.46">It has been shown that there is no moral basis for the large-scale violent defence of political communities, and that there are other, more effective alternatives. </s><s n="s5.10;p43.46">The question of humanitarian interventions is trickier. </s><s n="s6.10;p43.46">There is certainly a moral basis, possibly an obligation, for interference in states that commit widespread human rights violations. </s><s n="s7.10;p43.46">It has been suggested that war is not an efficient way of solving these problems, but neither is non-violent resistance. </s><s n="s8.10;p43.46">The focus, however, should not be on the solution to crises once they have begun, but the prevention of their ever occurring. </s><s n="s9.10;p43.46">The signs of such crises are not that difficult to spot, and with enough political will it would be possible to intervene peacefully, with economic and political aid, and prevent atrocities being committed. </s><s n="s10.10;p43.46">Unfortunately, much political energy and economic power is directed towards the preparation for war. </s></p><p n="p44.46"><s n="s1.3;p44.46">The issue of nuclear weapons has not been included in this paper, not because is not important, but because most just war criticisms of pacifism do not mention it. </s><s n="s2.3;p44.46">There are forms of pacifism that argue that nuclear weapons have such destructive potential that war should be abolished to avoid the possibility of their ever being used. </s><s n="s3.3;p44.46">This is indeed an important reason for eschewing war, especially as more and more countries acquire them, but there are other, more fundamental issues at stake, and which were the focus of this essay. </s></p><p n="p45.46"><s n="s1.11;p45.46">The arguments that regard the issue of means and ends are the most important in deciding whether war can ever be morally justifiable. </s><s n="s2.11;p45.46">If means and ends can be separated, then it may turn out that pacifism cannot be the right option in every case. </s><s n="s3.11;p45.46">However, it seems as if they are inextricably linked features of the moral life, and this provides a major point in favour of anti-war pacifism. </s><s n="s4.11;p45.46">As was discussed, violent self-defence can never be considered a good thing. </s><s n="s5.11;p45.46">Pacifism, however, can be considered intrinsically good. </s><s n="s6.11;p45.46">Peace is not the mere absence of war, but a lifestyle comprising the ability to compromise, to understand other's points of view and solve conflict without recourse to violence. </s><s n="s7.11;p45.46">The first step towards a war-free world must be the renunciation of violence. </s><s n="s8.11;p45.46">It may be said that a vision of a world with no war is utopian and naïve. </s><s n="s9.11;p45.46">That may be, but it must be pacifism, and not warism that is held up as an ideal to aspire to. </s><s n="s10.11;p45.46">At the beginning of this article it was claimed that pacifism is a "working hypothesis" (Wright and Augarde 1990: 9). </s><s n="s11.11;p45.46">There has never been a real, large-scale attempt to put pacifist principles into practice, but there is need
