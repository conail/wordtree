be examined on its own to make sure the reader first understands exactly what Montaigne is declaring. </s><s n="s2.4;p1.10">'To the Reader' is saying that the essays are not written to reach a wide audience, but merely for his close friends and family to have a way of remembering him more effectively when he has died. </s><s n="s3.4;p1.10">Montaigne does not intend to try and impress his readers, but purely intends to show the reader his views on many aspects of society 'you will read of my defects and my native form so far as respect for social convention allows'<ref

preface states, it is important to remember Montaigne's above points upon the reading of his following chapters, for it will undoubtedly influence the way we process and assimilate the information in our heads. </s><s n="s2.5;p2.10">I think the preface of any book is important whether work of fiction or fact, and can be wrongly ignored as I myself have done in eagerness to attack the main text. </s><s n="s3.5;p2.10">The preface enables us to understand the authors' intentions for his piece of writing, and in the case of <hi rend="italic">The Complete Essays</hi> is extremely important due to it being a work of fact. </s><s n="s4.5;p2.10">It tells us exactly why Montaigne decided to share his views with us, but that they are his views and should not be treated as anything else. </s><s n="s5.5;p2.10">With this in mind, the first chapter I intend to examine is chapter eighteen; <hi rend="italic">On Fear.</hi> </s></p><p n="p3.10"><s n="s1.6;p3.10">After first reading the chapter, one could be forgiven for questioning some of the examples Montaigne uses to demonstrate the different types of fear. </s><s n="s2.6;p3.10">This is especially true of the modern day reader, seeing as most of the examples come from the middle of wars, a topic the average person today would be unfamiliar with except for if he desired to read about it. </s><s n="s3.6;p3.10">Examples of two large troops of soldiers taking fright and 'fleeing to the place where the other had just fled from'<ref target="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.002"/> or a lone soldier running towards his enemy only to have 'realised what he was doing and headed back through the very same gap out of which he had...dashed'<ref target="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.003"/> sound farfetched, but if we are to read this in the context of the preface, we must believe it to be true. </s><s n="s4.6;p3.10">We can also infer that some or all of these experiences mentioned in the chapter are personal ones, as the preface states Montaigne intended to write for 'the private benefit of my friends and kinsmen'<ref target="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.004"/>. </s><s n="s5.6;p3.10">This being so is it possible Montaigne picked the juiciest personal examples he could think of so as to allow his audience to 'find here again some traits of my character and of my humours'<ref target="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.005"/>? </s><s n="s6.6;p3.10">This shows the importance of the preface for without it we would not be so sure as to whom his target audience was and why he possibly chose the examples he did. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.002"><p n="pn1.1"><s

lifetime, having probably lived through battles of some sort, and hearing fables of such cowardly deeds would probably believe the stories of fear and be more likely to take them at face value. </s><s n="s2.6;p4.10">Fellow readers of Montaigne's social status would probably, based on the preface, use the book as a way to remember him (if they knew him), or use it as a way to learn about his thoughts and views on all elements of society, (in this case fear) if they did not. </s><s n="s3.6;p4.10">For people lower in society who could read and were able to obtain a copy of the text the principles of what they were able to learn from the book would probably be the same. </s><s n="s4.6;p4.10">The importance of the preface here, is that for those readers who did not know Montaigne, they could take his word and believe that what they were reading was true, yet apparently not exaggerated. </s><s n="s5.6;p4.10">Montaigne also endears the reader to him by implying in the preface he is too humble for them to waste their time reading about him, and that the chapters are really the musings of a 'simple, natural'<ref target="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.006"/> man. </s><s n="s6.6;p4.10">This could have the reverse effect of making people read the book to find out why he states this, so in this way the preface is actually being used as a way to entice people to read <hi

</s></p></note><p n="p5.10"><s n="s1.7;p5.10">Montaigne states in the preface that this is 'a book whose faith can be trusted'<ref target="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.007"/> and does not 'seek the favour of the world'<ref target="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.008"/>. </s><s n="s2.7;p5.10">These statements are strengthened by the content of the chapter being looked at, he does a good job of cataloguing and ordering the different types of fear we humans experience. </s><s n="s3.7;p5.10">He talks of fear that 'puts wings at our heels'<ref target="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.009"/> but also of fear that 'hobbles us and nails our feet to the ground'<ref target="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.010"/> using humorous examples to keep the mood light. </s><s n="s4.7;p5.10">However, all these examples are taken from military escapades, which for someone trying to understand fear in a situation outside of war is not too helpful. </s><s n="s5.7;p5.10">Montaigne does state though 'I leave aside simple folk for whom fear sometimes conjures up visions of their great-grandsires rising out of their graves..." </s><ref target="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.011"/><s n="s6.7;p5.10">showing he has thought about other types of fear, but prefers to rely on his own views (as the preface states), of fear in war, for it is in soldiers that 'fear ought to be able to find very little room." </s><ref target="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.012"/><s n="s7.7;p5.10">Based on the confident and seemingly correct manner in which Montaigne categorises fear in this chapter, the reader would be more inclined to read other chapters believing that its writings can be trusted, as the author claims will be the case in the preface, so the content has indeed backed up the claim. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_3100a-ftnote.007"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1"><hi

different light. </s></p><p n="p7.10"><s n="s1.4;p7.10">In the chapter about fear, although it is also something we cannot see, it is easier to follow Montaigne's train of thought because he makes statements that categorize the emotion. </s><s n="s2.4;p7.10">In this chapter detailing smells, he makes more bold statements such as that of 'when people give off odours that are not their own, we

n="s4.4;p7.10">However, I know from the preface though that Montaigne is merely expressing his views for others to see, not attempting to force his views onto the reader, as could be implied if one

n="s5.8;p9.10">Based on Montaigne's style of writing it would be fairly clear after reading a portion of the book that these are his views on elements of culture and society. </s><s
