means that the same amount of mixer is used each time, and a uniform drink is produced. </s><s n="s3.5;p3.39">An advantage for Cowley Manor is that when charging for these drinks, the costing is simple as the unit price for each mixer is the amount that has to be covered in the price of the drink. </s><s n="s4.5;p3.39">The same is true for all beer, lager and cider. </s><s

noticed (Jake Osborne, House Manager). </s><s n="s6.8;p4.39">In order that the stock take figures are correct, all drinks that are taken from the bar but charged through a different department have to be noted down in a transfer book. </s><s n="s7.8;p4.39">For example, if the chef needs 50ml of brandy for a dessert, the cost would be attributable to the kitchen. </s><s n="s8.8;p4.39">It has to be

materials being added to the gross profit required (Burgess, 2001). </s><s n="s3.6;p5.39">This is a simplistic, but the most commonly used method of pricing. </s><s n="s4.6;p5.39">The House Manager,

Manor, only very small amounts of cash are handled. </s><s n="s2.5;p6.39">Almost all charges are made to bedrooms or credit/debit cards. </s><s n="s3.5;p6.39">However, it is still the case that all room and card charges have to be reconciled with the print out that is produced when the till is cashed off at the end of the shift (Appendix 8). </s><s n="s4.5;p6.39">Any variances in the amounts charged and the sales made have to be fully explained on the cashing up slip. </s><s n="s5.5;p6.39">As drinks bill are often transferred to the restaurant, this happens on a regular basis. </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="underlined">Purchasing and Security</head><p n="p7.39"><s n="s1.9;p7.39">The process of purchasing, taking delivery of, and storing stock is one that should be tightly controlled (Dittmer and Keefe, 2006). </s><s n="s2.9;p7.39">The ordering can be done in one of two ways. </s><s n="s3.9;p7.39">The periodic order method may be used, when an order of variable quantities is placed on a set date. </s><s n="s4.9;p7.39">Alternatively, the perpetual order method may be used, when an order is placed when necessary for a set amount (Dittmer and Keefe, 2006). </s><s n="s5.9;p7.39">At Cowley Manor, periodic ordering takes place. </s><s n="s6.9;p7.39">An order is made on a weekly basis, for the amount needed. </s><s n="s7.9;p7.39">This method requires the purchaser to have a good knowledge of the products that sell, and for them to be able to anticipate demand (Dittmer and Keefe, 2006). </s><s n="s8.9;p7.39">A record of the order is always made at the time of ordering. </s><s n="s9.9;p7.39">This allows the person who takes in the delivery to check that the correct goods have been delivered. </s></p><p n="p8.39"><s n="s1.4;p8.39">When orders are delivered, there is often not a member of bar staff at the hotel. </s><s n="s2.4;p8.39">This means that the order is not always correctly checked upon delivery. </s><s n="s3.4;p8.39">Checking the delivery involves counting the delivery and checking for breakages and broken seals. </s><s n="s4.4;p8.39">Brands should also be checked (Davis <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 1998). </s></p><p n="p9.39"><s n="s1.5;p9.39">Dittmer and Keefe (2006) believe that alcoholic beverages are prone to theft in the storage areas, and that security of stocks should be a high priority for any business. </s><s n="s2.5;p9.39">They suggest that the availability of keys to the storage areas is restricted to only two people. </s><s n="s3.5;p9.39">At Cowley Manor, all bar staff, as well as the restaurant supervisors and all managers have access to the drinks cellar. </s><s n="s4.5;p9.39">This could leave the hotel susceptible to unscrupulous members of staff taking advantage of a lack of security. </s><s n="s5.5;p9.39">However, stocks are kept low, and with so few bar staff, it would soon be noticed if liquor started to "walk." </s></p><p n="p10.39"><s n="s1.5;p10.39">There are many financial control procedures in place at Cowley Manor to ensure that all stock sold in the bar is accounted for. </s><s n="s2.5;p10.39">This includes the standard measures used and the cost calculations. </s><s n="s3.5;p10.39">The purchasing and supply of stock is a less well controlled area of the bar. </s><s n="s4.5;p10.39">Often, stock is not checked thoroughly on delivery, and is stored in an area accessible to a large number of staff. </s><s n="s5.5;p10.39">This is an area for improvement within the bar. </s></p></div2></div1><div1 type="text"><head rend="italic">How effective is your

aren't trained, then the business will be less successful, as the staff won't be as efficient. </s><s n="s4.5;p11.39">Training is the process whereby staff gain and develop knowledge through practical activities and instruction (Go <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 1996). </s><s n="s5.5;p11.39">In an ever-changing industry, the training should be on-going to keep up with developments. </s></p><p

training that takes place in larger organisations. </s><s n="s3.4;p12.39">Often, the management in SME's play many roles within the organisation, and so don't have such a specific perception of training (Davies and Ryan, 2005). </s><s n="s4.4;p12.39">At Cowley Manor, there are only 7 managers, all of whom take responsibility for training in each of their departments, alongside the running of

n="s4.9;p13.39">A lot of value is placed on this informal, on-the-job training. </s><s n="s5.9;p13.39">This type of training is often the most used, but also abused (Go <hi rend="italic">et al,</hi> 1996). </s><s n="s6.9;p13.39">As each new employee learns skills from other members of staff, it's possible that bad habits are handed down to new staff. </s><s n="s7.9;p13.39">On-the-job training should be planned in the same way that structured training is planned. </s><s n="s8.9;p13.39">This way, new staff learn the way the job should be done, rather than the way other staff do it. </s><s n="s9.9;p13.39">At Cowley Manor, on-the-job training is used in all of the departments, while some departments combine it with other training methods. </s></p></div2><div2><head

(Appendix 6). </s><s n="s5.5;p14.39">Manuals such as these enable staff to take the information away with them, and remind themselves of details at leisure (La Greca, 1988), but they can also be used

carried out, or away from the place of work (Go <hi rend="italic">et al,</hi> 1996). </s><s n="s3.10;p15.39">At Cowley Manor, the off-the-job training takes place at the hotel. </s><s n="s4.10;p15.39">This training is mainly carried out for the staff of the restaurant and the spa. </s><s n="s5.10;p15.39">The restaurant and bar teams recently took part in rum, wine and food tasting. </s><s n="s6.10;p15.39">This allowed the staff to learn about the products they sell on a daily basis in a pressure-free situation. </s><s n="s7.10;p15.39">They were also given the opportunity to take notes, so when guests ask for advice on choosing wine for example, the staff can share their knowledge (Appendix 7). </s><s n="s8.10;p15.39">The wine and food training was done by the House Manager, but the rum tasting and training was presented by an outside visitor. </s><s n="s9.10;p15.39">These examples both count as off-the-job training as they took place away from the work. </s><s

works. </s><s n="s2.9;p17.39">However, there are areas for improvement. </s><s n="s3.9;p17.39">In housekeeping, new employees are placed with another housekeeper and expected to learn from them. </s><s n="s4.9;p17.39">This means that bad habits are picked up. </s><s n="s5.9;p17.39">The Head Housekeeper doesn't train any of the new employees, so they don't learn how to clean a room to the required standard without cutting corners. </s><s n="s6.9;p17.39">Although cleaning guidance does exist for the housekeepers, it isn't used. </s><s n="s7.9;p17.39">Another area for improvement is the organisation of training. </s><s n="s8.9;p17.39">Except for c-side therapists, there are no training schedules for any new member of staff. </s><s n="s9.9;p17.39">This means that new employees have no set targets for completion of learning. </s></p><p n="p18.39"><s n="s1.6;p18.39">From researching the training that takes place at Cowley Manor, one concludes that training is of a satisfactory level. </s><s n="s2.6;p18.39">In all departments, excluding housekeeping, staff know their roles, and are knowledgeable of the products they are selling. </s><s n="s3.6;p18.39">In housekeeping, there is a need for more formal guidance, although the lack of training doesn't show in the standards of cleanliness. </s><s n="s4.6;p18.39">Although the management don't take part in formal training, they have enough experience between them, and also have the option to take on training if they wish. </s><s n="s5.6;p18.39">The staff at Cowley Manor take part in on-the-job training in the majority of cases,

and Whatley Manor came 10 <hi rend="sup">th</hi>. </s><s n="s6.8;p32.39">The other two hotels were not listed. </s><s n="s7.8;p32.39">In another poll by the same magazine of the world's top 100 destinations, Babington House came in at 77 <hi rend="sup">th</hi>, while Cowley Manor was placed at 83 <hi rend="sup">rd</hi> (Condé Nast Traveller, 2005). </s><s n="s8.8;p32.39">There isn't much to choose between the hotels, and it is interesting to note that many people that stay at Cowley Manor have stayed at the other hotels in this analysis. </s></p></div2></div1><div1 type="text"><head rend="italic">Within the department in which you work, examine how service quality is defined and managed</head><p n="p33.39"><s n="s1.10;p33.39">Within any hotel, the standard of cleanliness should be so high that it's almost unnoticeable to the guests. </s><s n="s2.10;p33.39">This report aims to compare the quality of cleaning within the public areas and rooms at Cowley Manor, with the quality of cleaning in the spa. </s><s n="s3.10;p33.39">Lockwood <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (1996) state that guests have certain expectations of an experience, and if these expectations are met or exceeded, then the guest will have had a 'quality' experience. </s><s n="s4.10;p33.39">In relation to Cowley Manor, guests arrive expecting a certain level of cleanliness to be maintained in the public areas, the rooms, and at the spa. </s><s n="s5.10;p33.39">If the expected levels of cleanliness are not attained, then 'quality' will not have been provided to the guest. </s><s n="s6.10;p33.39">Quality can also be defined as "conformance to requirements' (Crosby 1984, cited in Lockwood 1996). </s><s n="s7.10;p33.39">In the hospitality industry, a key aspect of quality is reliability (Lockwood <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 1996). </s><s n="s8.10;p33.39">A guest will expect the same level of cleanliness each time they visit Cowley Manor. </s><s n="s9.10;p33.39">For this reason, standardisation of cleaning processes is important. </s><s n="s10.10;p33.39">In theory, the guest should always receive the level of cleanliness that they are expecting as there is a set way of cleaning the various areas of the hotel (Understanding Hospitality Management Lecture 6, 2004). </s></p><div2><head rend="underlined">In The House</head><p n="p34.39"><s n="s1.6;p34.39">The rooms and public areas in Cowley Manor are maintained by a group of housekeepers, working between 9am and 9pm. </s><s n="s2.6;p34.39">The housekeeping department has a checklist of jobs that is to be completed in each room (Appendix 1). </s><s n="s3.6;p34.39">However, this checklist is not given to housekeepers on a daily basis, as it is assumed that they know what they have to do. </s><s n="s4.6;p34.39">This means that the standardisation of cleaning methods are not followed, although there is a standard process. </s><s n="s5.6;p34.39">Kandampully <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (2001) believe that if frontline members of staff, such as housekeepers, are not given a high enough status, they may not be inclined to work to the full capabilities, due to job dissatisfaction. </s><s n="s6.6;p34.39">This could be a reason for the less than enthusiastic attitude of the housekeepers towards their job. </s></p><p n="p35.39"><s n="s1.4;p35.39">Another guidance sheet is available for the turning down of beds in the evening (Appendix 2). </s><s n="s2.4;p35.39">Again, this sheet is not given out on a regular basis, or displayed anywhere within the housekeeping office. </s><s n="s3.4;p35.39">Although turndown is a less thorough clean of a room, there are still tasks to be performed, such as changing towels and emptying bins. </s><s n="s4.4;p35.39">When a housekeeper has been performing a job for a while, it's possible that they may become slightly complacent. </s></p><p n="p36.39"><s n="s1.4;p36.39">The public areas of the hotel are cleaned on a daily basis, with vacuuming and dusting taking place. </s><s n="s2.4;p36.39">The toilets are also checked three times a day. </s><s n="s3.4;p36.39">However, there is no checklist or timetable of jobs that have to be done in the public areas on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (Neal Spencer, Head Housekeeper). </s><s n="s4.4;p36.39">Due to this, some important tasks, such as removing cobwebs from the ceiling aren't done regularly, and may be noticed by guests. </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="underlined">At C-Side</head><p n="p37.39"><s n="s1.7;p37.39">At C-side, the spa at Cowley Manor, the cleaning is carried out by the receptionists and the therapists when they have free time between treatments. </s><s n="s2.7;p37.39">There is a daily checklist of cleaning tasks that has to be completed (Appendix 3). </s><s n="s3.7;p37.39">This ensures that the spa is always immaculately tidy and clean. </s><s n="s4.7;p37.39">This checklist is a very useful tool for the staff at C-side (Gilly Willis, Spa Receptionist), as it means everyone knows what tasks need to be performed at certain times of day, and what has not yet been done. </s><s n="s5.7;p37.39">At the spa, there is also a chart of tasks that have to be performed on a weekly basis. </s><s n="s6.7;p37.39">These tasks ensure that all deep cleaning is done regularly. </s><s n="s7.7;p37.39">By doing the jobs more regularly, they are easier, and the fittings remain in better order. </s></p><p n="p38.39"><s n="s1.7;p38.39">Cowley Manor closes for 5 days each winter, to allow for maintenance to be carried out that is impossible to carry out when guests are around. </s><s n="s2.7;p38.39">This period would also be an opportunity to do some deep cleaning in the hotel rooms and public areas, such as shower drains, and cleaning under large items of furniture, such as sofas. </s><s n="s3.7;p38.39">The cleaning of drains is an example where the hotel and the spa differ. </s><s n="s4.7;p38.39">In the spa, the shower drains are lifted and deep cleaned on a weekly basis, whereas in the rooms, this task is carried out once a year, during the winter shutdown period (Amy Terry, Housekeeper). </s><s n="s5.7;p38.39">This means that drains in the bedrooms can smell, and this is experienced when working in the housekeeping department. </s><s n="s6.7;p38.39">There is a formal list of tasks to be completed by the housekeepers during winter shutdown, which means that staff know what they are doing over the course of the week (Appendix 4). </s><s n="s7.7;p38.39">At the spa, this list is drawn up in the weeks before shutdown. </s></p><p n="p39.39"><s n="s1.4;p39.39">From the research carried out, one is inclined to conclude that the cleanliness of the spa is managed more effectively than that of the main house. </s><s n="s2.4;p39.39">There is far more guidance at the spa as to what, and how, tasks are carried out. </s><s n="s3.4;p39.39">However, it is very rare that there are complaints about cleanliness in any areas of the hotel from guests (Alex Burgel, House Manager). </s><s n="s4.4;p39.39">This would suggest that the housekeepers do just enough surface cleaning to satisfy the guests expectations, and so quality in cleaning is provided by Cowley Manor as a whole. </s></p></div2></div1></body><back><div1 type="missing or external appendix"><p/></div1></back></text></TEI.2>
