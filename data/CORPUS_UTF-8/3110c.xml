at line three the language of the Mercury inhabitant emerges and this is starkly different to the English. </s><s n="s2.4;p3.15">Interestingly, though, even when the languages are so different early on, the Mercury inhabitant still poses a question and with the use of the question mark the reader is able to understand even slightly what is happening in the situation. </s><s n="s3.4;p3.15">Both parties here seem confused as the next speaker (the English character), delegates another question. </s><s n="s4.4;p3.15">This process is continued throughout the text, only reinforcing how this is concerning with understanding between unfamiliar languages. </s></p><p n="p4.15"><s n="s1.4;p4.15">The speech is arranged into various stresses, with the repeated use of exclamation marks and the visual representation of what is happening in the scene is full of action in their speech. </s><s n="s2.4;p4.15">Words are often highlighted with the use of speech marks to show how the speaker would be emphasising the word with their own speech and reassuring the reader of what is important. </s><s n="s3.4;p4.15">The use of speech marks also shows that the other speaker whom the first is addressing perhaps doesn't understand what they are saying, and by somehow enhancing it would make it easier for them. </s><s n="s4.4;p4.15">A good example of this is in 11-14, where the English speaker repeatedly stresses the words that seem important, like 'land', 'sea', and 'men'. </s></p><p n="p5.15"><s n="s1.3;p5.15">However it appears that this process has not enlightened the inhabitant of Mercury, as their response is only to question again in line 12 ('Menhawl!?'). </s><s n="s2.3;p5.15">Following this, though, there appears to be a bridge of understanding at line 20 when the Mercurian repeats the sound made by 'leader' and transfers it into something which can be understood by them with 'yuleeda'. </s><s n="s3.3;p5.15">This poses the question as to whether or not words are defined by the ability to copy the sound they make or to understand their meaning and where the meaning is inherited from. </s></p><p n="p6.15"><s n="s1.5;p6.15">After this turn at line 20, and the speech just after it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of who the speaker is. </s><s n="s2.5;p6.15">Whatsmore, because neither of the speakers have names it is seemingly left for the reader to interpret and monitor the dialogue themselves. </s><s n="s3.5;p6.15">The speech between lines 24 and 34 becomes quite confusing because it is almost all undecipherable, and is mixed between languages apart from phrases which occasionally emerge in English like 'there is no more talk' (33) and the rare word strewn between what one must assume is the language of the Mercurian. </s><s n="s4.5;p6.15">The person who has invaded this planet (the people from Earth), have quickly acquired the language of those which they intended to conquer. </s><s n="s5.5;p6.15">This brings many connotations of power, the acquisition of language and ownership of people to mind because when people invade a country their language tends to take over, however the invaders appear not to have much power here as it is the Mercurians who have the dominance with language and the people from Earth are sent back (37), perhaps unfulfilled by what they have learnt. </s></p><p n="p7.15"><s n="s1.3;p7.15">John Agard's poem, <hi rend="italic">Listen Mr Oxford Don</hi> deals with a similar subject matter but in a far more personal and recognisable way. </s><s n="s2.3;p7.15"><hi rend="italic">Listen Mr Oxford Don</hi> is split into eight sections, of varying length and with rhyme that is repeated throughout. </s><s n="s3.3;p7.15">The first verse begins with the speaker introducing themselves directly, and using a double negative as a way to describe them ('Me not no'), this introduction is giving insight to how the speaker will keep describing themselves by comparisons to things which are usually considering negative. </s></p><p n="p8.15"><s n="s1.4;p8.15">There is rhyme within the first verse which pairs the first and third line together, and separately associates the second, forth and fifth; the use of this would be to compare what each line is concerned with, i.e comparing a graduate to an immigrant, which 4 and 5 do. </s><s n="s2.4;p8.15">The combination of rhyme and the colloquialisms of speech create strong rhythm throughout this poem, sped up in the second verse where all the lines follow an a,a,a,a, rhyme scheme which makes them quicker to read as they flow on from one another and have a defined relationship. </s><s n="s3.4;p8.15">The colloquialisms also manage to show how the speaker has distorted the language (English), which has been imposed upon him, for his own use and to express himself better. </s><s n="s4.4;p8.15">There is also a slight indication in the colloquialisms that the speaker may have a Jamaican accent, as some readers may be familiar with how the Jamaican accent pronounces 'th' as 'd'; this is written from line 7 and continues throughout. </s></p><p n="p9.15"><s n="s1.3;p9.15">Notably there is also no use of punctuation in this text, and this could have been purposefully done because <hi rend="italic">Listen Mr Oxford Don</hi> is meant to be performance poetry, and therefore the marking of punctuation would make it more difficult for individuals to perform it in their own way. </s><s n="s2.3;p9.15">Also it could be that John Agard is reinforcing his point of claiming back language and that written punctuation is irrelevant in the speech of language. </s><s n="s3.3;p9.15">Strangely though, the use of capital letters is still present when declaring proper nouns throughout. </s></p><p n="p10.15"><s n="s1.4;p10.15">John Agard repeatedly introduces the speaker with 'I' and makes sure that the reader is aware of how conscious the speaker is of themself and what they want to achieve with the statements they make. </s><s n="s2.4;p10.15">There is also a clear relationship marked out between stanza two (lines 6 to 9) and stanza five (lines 18 to 21). </s><s n="s3.4;p10.15">Primarily this relationship is outlined by the connection of rhyme scheme, but on closer inspection it is clear how these sections relate to one another; they mark the turns in the poem. </s><s n="s4.4;p10.15">The first turn appears at the end of the second stanza with the introduction of danger, and this theme is carried on to the next two sections before stanza five where there is a line repeated to mark the similarities and the break ('is a dangerous one', lines 9 and 21). </s></p><p n="p11.15"><s n="s1.4;p11.15">After line 21 the stanzas get longer and the language becomes less involved with violence and more with peacefulness and humanness, the notion that a person can be civil and humane without having to be English. </s><s n="s2.4;p11.15">The speaker than goes on to claim that the violent acts he may have committed against language were in self defence (35); self defence perhaps against the oppressiveness and authority of the English language on someone, especially someone who has not inherited it's goodness. </s><s n="s3.4;p11.15">Interesting as the reader develops a relationship with the poem there seem little or no need for punctuation, and the reader is able to adapt the way the words appear to be spoken to suit them. </s><s n="s4.4;p11.15">I think this is the essence of what John Agard is encouraging people to do when reading this poem, and is what he is professing has not happened to him in his experience of acquiring a language which promotes what is 'proper' and in turn making the speaker property of the language and not the language property of the speaker. </s></p><p n="p12.15"><s n="s1.4;p12.15">My response to these two texts was a short poem continuing on the theme which John Agard introduced in <hi rend="italic">Listen Mr Oxford Don</hi>. </s><s n="s2.4;p12.15">I felt that the acquisition and the authority of language is something which is very familiar to me, as a student, as language is changing and as a woman. </s><s n="s3.4;p12.15">The ownership of language or its ownership of the speaker is a theme that has been troublesome to woman and people who have been oppressed for a long time because it seems like a struggle to develop one's own voice and language. </s><s n="s4.4;p12.15">Therefore with my response I was trying to illustrate how misunderstanding of eachother, and sometimes fear and result in people missing the most beautiful part of language; and that is, that it is able to change and it can mean something to every individual despite it's ability to be uniting for a large group. </s></p><p n="p13.15"><s n="s1.4;p13.15">In this poem the speaker is voicing their opinion on how others view them, and how their developments and way of life sometimes come across as dangerous, but this is only because they have not been given the chance to be understood. </s><s n="s2.4;p13.15">Slang is often thought of a lesser language and is even a derogatory term to refer the language of someone who is lower class, a teenager, or an ethic minority. </s><s n="s3.4;p13.15">All of the current connotations to slang are very negative, yet this is simply because people don't understand and are therefore afraid of those who use it. </s><s n="s4.4;p13.15">This poem is showing that slang is a positive development in the English language, which makes it more accessible to people and allows them to be liberated not oppressed by it; slang is the language of people who may sometimes feel like they have no voice. </s></p><p n="p14.15"><s n="s1.3;p14.15">I have used punctuation in this poem, and I have used capital letters in conventional places, and in doing so I was trying to show how slang and proper English can work alongside one another. </s><s n="s2.3;p14.15">The voice here is of only one speaker, yet the use of 'bruv', 'bredren', 'yard' and 'ends' shows how this language is common among the speaker and his close friends and family. </s><s n="s3.3;p14.15">There is no purposeful rhyme in this poem because I felt that the feature was the words and they relate to eachother and have strong rhythm without the over complications of rhyme. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined">Third, constructed text</head><quote lang="English"><hi rend="bold">Language no Liberty</hi> Dis is me yard, me and me bredren.
