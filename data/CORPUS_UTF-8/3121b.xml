For instance, its economic and political situations are very unstable. </s><s n="s5.6;p1.42">Indeed, Nepal has an extremely low GDP per capita and literacy rate compared to the UK, as its unemployment rate is nearly ten times higher than the British. </s><s n="s6.6;p1.42">The Nepalese culture, compared to the UK's using Hofstede's dimensions scores a higher power distance, a lower masculinism and individualism. </s></p><p n="p2.42"><s n="s1.6;p2.42">It is recommended that Monarka should adopt an ethnocentric orientation during the first years of operation in Nepal, then to move to a polycentric orientation to finally reach a geocentric approach. </s><s n="s2.6;p2.42">The organisation should adopt a human resource management approach as much as possible, as opposed to a personnel management approach. </s><s n="s3.6;p2.42">By doing so, the company will be more strategically oriented and will focus on long-term performance by investing in training, rewarding and by considering its employees as assets. </s><s n="s4.6;p2.42">Resourcing the organisation will be a challenge, considering the weak condition of the labour market, but will be possible through a well define work design, and through a horizontal specialisation. </s><s n="s5.6;p2.42">It is recommended that the company adopts a diversity management approach when dealing with the differences between the employees (sex, religion, culture, etc.) in order to make best use of these differences by using them as competitive advantage. </s><s n="s6.6;p2.42">All these recommendations are taking into account the unique features of the business environment and of the local culture, in order for the human resource strategy and for the company to be integrated as much as possible in the new environment. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">1. INTRODUCTION</head><p n="p3.42"><s n="s1.4;p3.42">The dynamic competitive international business environment of the twenty-first century has brought companies to manage daily operation in different countries, with different cultures. </s><s n="s2.4;p3.42">The present report follows the decision of Monarka Hotel Group to open a subsidiary in Nepal. </s><s n="s3.4;p3.42">Funded in 1952, Monarka hotel group is a UK based hotel chain which operates 3 different brands in all continents, including Asia. </s><s n="s4.4;p3.42">A recent marketing study has shown the viability of the Monarka Hotel brand in Nepal (appendix 1). </s></p><p n="p4.42"><s n="s1.4;p4.42">Nepal is one of the poorest countries of the world. </s><s n="s2.4;p4.42">Nevertheless, as the land of the lord Buddha, its culture and history is very rich. </s><s n="s3.4;p4.42">Considered by the UNESCO as a natural museum for its genuine diversity, it is also a geographical sanctuary, with eight of the ten highest peaks in the world, including the famous Everest Mountain. </s><s n="s4.4;p4.42">Nepal's capital is Kathmandu, which is located in a valley at a 1'310 m altitude and has a population of 1.5 millions (NTB, 2006). </s></p><p n="p5.42"><s n="s1.3;p5.42">The Monarka brand in Nepal would be located in Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, offering 135 rooms. </s><s n="s2.3;p5.42">The five-star hotel aims to provide a unique customer experience through operational excellence, and targets a westernised luxury market, that is the affluent American and European market. </s><s n="s3.3;p5.42">To provide a great work environment is also part of the organisation's mission statement. </s></p><p n="p6.42"><s n="s1.1;p6.42">The present document analyses the different challenges of managing personnel in Nepal compared to the UK, and proposes several alternatives and strategies to effectively manage people. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">2. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS</head><p n="p7.42"><s n="s1.7;p7.42">In order to evaluate how different is the business environment in Nepal compared to the UK, a comparative analysis is conducted. </s><s n="s2.7;p7.42">The comparative analysis is particularly appropriate in this case because, even though many aspects of the personnel management will be the same, i.e. the key functions, some aspects will be different since they are influenced by country specific factors and circumstances (Harris <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s3.7;p7.42">, 2003). </s><s n="s4.7;p7.42">The comparative analysis enables to point out which are those main differences. </s><s n="s5.7;p7.42">The most suitable framework to compare both businesses environments is the PESTE analysis, since it also allows identifying growth opportunities (Johnson <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s6.7;p7.42">, 2006). </s><s n="s7.7;p7.42">The following analysis contrasts the Political, Economical, Social, Technological and Environmental factors in a human resource perspective for the company to adapt its strategy to Nepal's environment. </s></p><div2><head rend="bold">2.1 Political environment </head><p n="p8.42"><s n="s1.7;p8.42">The political environment greatly influences businesses decisions and also human behaviour. </s><s n="s2.7;p8.42">All the laws and regulations worldwide, varying between countries and regions create a challenging political environment and, as regulations change, organisations must adapt their strategies and practices (Hodgetts and Luthans, 1997). </s><s n="s3.7;p8.42">The political environment in Nepal as a whole is much more unstable than the UK's. </s><s n="s4.7;p8.42">Even thought both governments are constitutional monarchies with a legal system based on the common law, the level of democracy and of freedom regarding the civil and political rights in Nepal is lower than the UK (appendix 2). </s><s n="s5.7;p8.42">This indicates that the Nepalese population has less liberty in developing opinions, organisations and individual autonomy apart from the state (CIFP, 2000). </s><s n="s6.7;p8.42">In fact, Nepal's political unstable political environment has long been associated with a perpetual conflict with the Maoist rebel group, led by the Communist party (US Department of State, 2006). </s><s n="s7.7;p8.42">However, very recently, a peace accord has been signed between the Maoist rebels and the Nepalese government, assuring a greater harmony and freedom in the country (BBC, 2006). </s></p><p n="p9.42"><s n="s1.8;p9.42">Another major difference between both countries political environment is the corruption rate. </s><s n="s2.8;p9.42">Nepal classifies itself as having one of the highest corruption rates in the world (Miles <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s3.8;p9.42">, 2006), whether the UK's is fairly low and representative of its healthy economy and political situation (appendix 2). </s><s n="s4.8;p9.42">Indeed, the Nepalese government seems very unstable in the distribution of permits, licenses and other legal document and services (Miles <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s5.8;p9.42">, 2006). </s><s n="s6.8;p9.42">Additionally, strikes and public protests are frequent and arise on short notice (Investment Climate, 2006). </s><s n="s7.8;p9.42">It is important that the company particularly considers this aspect since it can clearly affect the business by rising work absenteeism. </s><s n="s8.8;p9.42">These public protests might be less frequent as a result of the peace agreement, but the company should still elaborate a strategy to ensure the level of business is not affected by these events when they occur. </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="bold">2.2 Economic environment</head><p n="p10.42"><s n="s1.8;p10.42">The economic environment is closely related to the political stability, and to the potential risk of investment in a country (Deresky, 2003). </s><s n="s2.8;p10.42">As the economic environment changes faster than the political, companies must be able to benefit from it (Hodgetts and Luthans, 1997). </s><s n="s3.8;p10.42">The economic environment of the UK compared to Nepal's differs in its magnitude. </s><s n="s4.8;p10.42">In fact, Nepal's GDP is nearly ten times smaller than the UK's (appendix 2). </s><s n="s5.8;p10.42">The economic factors that will affect he most the management of human resources is the GDP per capita and the proportion of the population below poverty line. </s><s n="s6.8;p10.42">With an incredibly low minimum wage (23 USD/month), the GDP per capita in Nepal is of 1,400 USD per year, which is nearly 22 times lower than the UK (CIA, 2005). </s><s n="s7.8;p10.42">Hence, the standards of living in Nepal are very low, as more than a third of the population live below the poverty line (appendix 2). </s><s n="s8.8;p10.42">Furthermore, the unemployment rate in Nepal is almost ten times higher than the UK's with 42% compared to 4.7%. </s></p><p n="p11.42"><s n="s1.5;p11.42">Nepal being still an agricultural economy employs 76% of its workforce in this sector (CIA, 2004) whether it is only 1.5% of the workforce for the UK (CIA, 2005). </s><s n="s2.5;p11.42">Even though the service sector contributes to 41% of Nepal's GDP, it employs only 18% of the workforce. </s><s n="s3.5;p11.42">In UK, services accounts for 75.8% of the GDP by employing 79.5% of the workforce. </s><s n="s4.5;p11.42">In 2006, the travel and tourism sector in the economy is expected to contribute to 8.2% of the GDP, creating 6.4% of the total employment (WTTC, 2006a). </s><s n="s5.5;p11.42">In UK, this sector of the economy should account for 9.4% of GDP with 8.8% of the total employment (WTTC, 2006b). </s></p><p n="p12.42"><s n="s1.3;p12.42">The other factors of the economic environment such as imports, exports or taxing policies have less influence on the human resource management. </s><s n="s2.3;p12.42">Regarding the trade agreements, it is nonetheless important to know that, after India and Tibet, the United Kingdom is the most favoured nation for the exportation of goods (Government of Nepal, 2006). </s><s n="s3.3;p12.42">This supposes good trading relations between the two countries and might facilitate the process for home country nationals to enter Nepal, if judged necessary. </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="bold">2.3 Socio-cultural environment</head><p n="p13.42"><s n="s1.8;p13.42">Both countries are secular and very multiethnic. </s><s n="s2.8;p13.42">Nepal's main religion is Hindu and UK's is Christian (appendix 2). </s><s n="s3.8;p13.42">For both countries, the most populated segment of the population is the 15-64 years old strata (appendix 2). </s><s n="s4.8;p13.42">However, Nepal's population growth rate is much higher, with 2.17% than the UK's with only 0.28%, which is representative of a developed westernised country (appendix 2). </s><s n="s5.8;p13.42">The major difference between the two countries is the literacy rate. </s><s n="s6.8;p13.42">In fact, less than half the population of Nepal is literate, whether in the UK it is not a concern (appendix 2). </s><s n="s7.8;p13.42">This fact has a major impact over the human resources management, foremost for a service business where the required qualifications are higher than in the manufacture or agriculture industry. </s><s n="s8.8;p13.42">Indeed, the workforce being already limited, the fact that half the population is illiterate might complicate recruitment for qualified personnel. </s></p><p n="p14.42"><s n="s1.7;p14.42">Cultural differences must be contrasted when analysing different environments, as cultural dimensions provide a tool to understand people's beliefs and behaviors (Romani, 2004). </s><s n="s2.7;p14.42">Culture is shown through different levels: surface manifestations, values and basic assumptions (Harris <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s3.7;p14.42">, 2003). </s><s n="s4.7;p14.42">In order to identify the cultural differences and similarities between Nepal and the UK, Hofstede's cultural dimensions are used. </s><s n="s5.7;p14.42">Hofstede categorises culture in different dimensions that are said to be universal since they denote factors applicable in every society (Romani, 2004); four of them are used in the present analysis. </s><s n="s6.7;p14.42">In Hofstede's study, Nepal's dimensions of culture have not been considered, but India's dimensions are present. </s><s n="s7.7;p14.42">The socio-cultural similarities between Nepal and India are important enough to use India's cultural dimensions for the comparison (Kansakar, 2001, Adhikari and Muller, 2001). </s></p><p n="p15.42"><s n="s1.4;p15.42"><hi rend="bold">Power distance</hi> refers to the existing relationship between supervisors and subordinates (Romani, 2004) and if they accept that power is distributed unequally (Hodgetts and Luthans, 1997). </s><s n="s2.4;p15.42">Nepal scores a higher power distance than the United Kingdom, meaning that Nepalese organisations are more likely to be centralised (Hodgetts and Luthans, 1997). </s><s n="s3.4;p15.42">There are subsequently more barriers between hierarchical strata (Romani, 2004) than in the UK, where low power distance indicates that organisations tend to be more decentralised, considering employees and managers on the same level. </s><s n="s4.4;p15.42">According to Hofstede, a high power distance is representative of poorer countries (Hofstede, 1984). </s></p><p n="p16.42"><s n="s1.4;p16.42"><hi rend="bold">Uncertainty avoidance</hi> refers to the degree which employees feel comfortable in taking new actions or risk when facing a new or uncertain situation (Romani, 2004). </s><s n="s2.4;p16.42">Both countries have relatively low uncertainty avoidance, meaning that the company can function with less written rules as managers will be more risk-taking to serve the organisation (Hodgetts and Luthans, 1997). </s><s n="s3.4;p16.42">Nevertheless, uncertainty avoidance greatly varies from an organisation to another within a country. </s><s n="s4.4;p16.42">Low uncertainty avoidance is more likely to happen in smaller organisations, and where the population is denser in poorer countries (Hofstede, 1984). </s></p><p n="p17.42"><s n="s1.5;p17.42"><hi rend="bold">Individualism</hi> is the tendency of people to take actions that benefit themselves or their immediate family. </s><s n="s2.5;p17.42">Opposite from individualism is collectivism, where people tend to act in the interest of a group, as they look more after themselves (Hodgetts and Luthans, 1997). </s><s n="s3.5;p17.42">As a wealthy advanced country, UK scores high in individualism, whether Nepal is in between with collectivism. </s><s n="s4.5;p17.42">Often, the higher the GDP, the most individualist is the society (Hofstede, 1984). </s><s n="s5.5;p17.42">Collectivism being higher in Nepal, it might be important to have a collective organisation of work (Romani, 2004). </s></p><p n="p18.42"><s n="s1.2;p18.42"><hi

most important aspects are intrinsic and refer to interpersonal aspect of work such as good cooperation and work-relationships (Romani, 2004). </s><s n="s2.2;p18.42">Nepal scoring lower in masculinity than the UK, it is expected that factors such as a friendly atmosphere at work, employment security and co-operation will be as important as other more material factors (Hodgetts and Luthans, 1997)

transportation and communication services are widely available and deserve all the country. </s><s n="s6.9;p20.42">The fact that the Nepalese technological environment is less developed than the UK must be taken into account when developing the human resource strategies. </s><s n="s7.9;p20.42">Indeed, communication systems must be revised as they might not be functional in Nepal. </s><s n="s8.9;p20.42">Also, the poor roadway condition might complicate transportation for employees living far from their workplace. </s><s n="s9.9;p20.42">Nevertheless, those potential complications

Environmental factor</head><p n="p21.42"><s n="s1.3;p21.42">Nepal's environment is characterised by its particular geography. </s><s n="s2.3;p21.42">As a landlocked country with poor infrastructure, the supply of goods as food and beverage might not be as easy as in the UK.

MANAGING DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY</head><p n="p39.42"><s n="s1.15;p39.42">With globalisation, frontiers between countries are dissipating as their population gets more culturally diverse. </s><s n="s2.15;p39.42">Minority groups face disadvantages and organisations must develop policies and strategies in order to minimise discrimination and to maximise the potential opportunities created by this diversity of the workforce (Torrington <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s><s n="s3.15;p39.42">, 2005). </s><s n="s4.15;p39.42">Organisations can, whether opt for an equal opportunity (EO) approach with the purpose of reducing discrimination, or a diversity management (DM) approach, in order to maximise the potential of each employee (Torrington <hi rend="italic"> et al.</hi> </s><s n="s5.15;p39.42">, 2005). </s><s n="s6.15;p39.42">In fact, as the EO approach focuses on specific groups, the DM approach concentrates more on the individual (appendix 7). </s><s n="s7.15;p39.42">Even though both approaches seem contradictory, there is a consensus that both tendencies are valid (Hyman, 2004). </s><s n="s8.15;p39.42">Even though both approaches are needed to ensure progress, the organisation must focus on a particular one. </s><s n="s9.15;p39.42">As Monarka opts for a human resource management approach and a horizontal specialisation (Hales, 1987) approach for its operational workforce, it is logical that it tends to focus on the DM as well. </s><s n="s10.15;p39.42">In fact, in the DM approach, employees are expected to work in harmony, and line managers are considered as the key managers. </s><s n="s11.15;p39.42">The DM focuses on the individual by giving opportunities to all its employees. </s><s n="s12.15;p39.42">This characteristic suits the strong internal labour market orientation by giving the opportunities to operational staff to become managers. </s><s n="s13.15;p39.42">As the Nepalese population is very multicultural (U.S. Department of State, 2006), by adopting a DM approach, Monarka wants to consider the individual differences as an opportunity and use them in order to create a unique competitive advantage. </s><s n="s14.15;p39.42">No discrimination, "directly or indirectly, against older or disabled people, women, ethnic minorities or people with different sexual orientations" will be tolerated, nor in the organisation, or in the recruitment process (Torrington <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s15.15;p39.42">, 2005:538). </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">9.

The last brand is the most widespread of the group with hotels America, Europe, Australia and Asia. It aims to deliver an exclusive, unique customer experience through exceptional services and facilities. The group would now like to expand its activities to the Indian subcontinent. </p><p>A recent marketing research has analysed the viability of the Monarka Hotel brand in Nepal and proposed several suggestions. First of all, after an evaluation of the demand, though it is highly seasonal, it has been concluded that the main driver of demand is for the international leisure tourist, followed by the international business. In fact, due to the poor economic condition of the country, the domestic tourism is negligible and limited to the business segment. The competition in the market sector has been analysed using the Porter's framework of the five forces. The key drivers of competition in the five-star hotel market of the Nepalese hospitality industry are identified as the threat of new entrants and the power of suppliers. In fact, the research has shown that it is easy to penetrate Nepal's hospitality market since the government lowered the requirements for that particular industry. Also, the power of suppliers is important and concerns the lack of skilled workforce and the potential difficulty to obtain specialised food and beverage supplies. </p><p>Due to the country's significant political instability, it has been analysed to choose a mode of entry into the market that did not require a major investment and that facilitated the repatriation of profits to the UK. This preferred mode of entry is the management contract, which allows control of the operations on a daily basis, without owning the property. The primary target market identified, following the analysis of demand and the chain major market, is the luxury westernised (American and European) market, followed by the westernised business market as a second, minor segment. To target a market foreign to the home country or to the region's host country brings the brand to choose geocentrism as a strategic orientation for its marketing activities. Monarka, a harder brand, tend to be more standardised even though some elements (décor, restaurant menu, etc.) are adapted to a certain extend to the Nepalese culture. With 135 rooms, Monarka is located in Kathmandu and is the smaller luxury hotel of its competitor set. This enables the company to gain a competitive advantage in offering privacy. Aiming to be one of the leaders in the luxurious market by offering an exclusive customer experience, its prices will be set accordingly, that is one of the highest in the market (Malouin, 2006).</p><p rend="bold">Appendix 2 : PESTE analysis</p><p rend="bold">Appendix 3: Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions</p><p rend="bold">Appendix 4: Human resource management versus personnel management approach</p><p>Torrington and Hall, 1996</p><p>Torrington <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi>, 2005</p><p rend="bold">Appendix 5: Strategic Orientation</p><p>Hodgetts and Luthans, 1997</p><p>Harzing, 2004</p><p>Perlmutter, 1969</p><p>Roper, 1997</p><p rend="italic">Note: Some of the regiocentric characteristics have been deduced from ethno- or geocentrism as this approach is not present in all texts about centricity.</p><p rend="bold">Appendix 6: Implications of hiring PCNs as key managers</p><p>Source: Harzing, 2004a</p><p rend="bold">Appendix 7: Equal opportunities versus diversity management</p><p>Source: Torrington <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi>, 2005</p></div1></back></text></TEI.2>
