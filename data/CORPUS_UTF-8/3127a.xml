Consider the following citation from Girard (1986: 11-12), quoted by Gavrielos (accessed 1/9/06). Girard believes that the eclectic teacher aims to achieve <hi rend="italic">"the maximum benefit from all the methods and techniques at his or her disposal, according to the special needs and resources of his/her pupils at any given time"</hi> Girard's view is that a teacher should make a serious analysis of a given teaching situation, and make personal choices on the basis of the questions asked about that teaching situation, and on the basis of tools and techniques useable in the teaching context.. In the light of the theories and themes covered in this module on language learning, defend the personal choices you would make/ have made with your students in the approach you adopt to teaching them in your teaching context. Outline what language teaching issues would be relevant to your choices, what questions might arise for you in regard to your student needs, and discuss the rationale for the decisions you would make, given that your aim would be to enhance your students' learning opportunities. Also consider any limitations or constraints that would come into your decision making. Link your discussion to relevant input from background reading, learning theory, module input or discussion, and reflections on own experiences of learning from your logbook. C.

tailoring our teaching to fit the changing classroom and choosing any option available to us which achieves our aims and is in line with our principles. </s><s n="s5.9;p8.37">The teacher who has a consistent philosophy or rationale can be said to make principled decisions about what and how to teach. </s><s n="s6.9;p8.37">This approach addresses the present multiplicity of contexts and differences of learners themselves. </s><s n="s7.9;p8.37">It is an approach that draws on all the experience and training of a teacher;

repetition is helpful when trying to learn any new skill, or to correct fossilized errors. </s><s n="s4.6;p33.37">I might incorporate drilling a form or phrase helping with automaticity. </s><s n="s5.6;p33.37">Errors at this and other stages need correcting. </s><s n="s6.6;p33.37">I believe self-correction or peer correction facilitates learning whilst there is good evidence to show that teacher recasts are ineffective (Spada, 1993). </s></p><p n="p34.37"><s n="s1.8;p34.37">Despite arguments to the contrary I consider that grammar instruction facilitates learning. </s><s n="s2.8;p34.37">It can help with noticing, reasoning, analysing contrastively and can address students' questions arising from hypothesising (Hedge). </s><s n="s3.8;p34.37">Following the notion of a varied and balanced approach, structures and lexical items can be presented inductively or deductively, within a context. </s><s n="s4.8;p34.37">As in Task Based Learning (TBL) focus on form can occur through students becoming 'text investigators' (Willis 1996), at the end of a task, or through consciousness raising activities (CR). </s><s n="s5.8;p34.37">Or it can be teacher-led and part of a pre-determined syllabus in exam classes. </s><s n="s6.8;p34.37">Because students have different speeds of uptake, my objective is that all students will <hi rend="bold">understand</hi> the TL but for some, due to their developmental stage, it may not be acquired. </s><s n="s7.8;p34.37">For others it will be consolidation. </s><s n="s8.8;p34.37">(Lightbown and Spada, 1993;
