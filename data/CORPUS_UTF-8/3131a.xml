Instead she alternates between J and K and uses half-rhyme. </s><s n="s5.6;p3.4">This would perhaps strengthen the content of these lines though, as the poet talks of "roam(ing)" and "find(ing)" - general feelings of disorientation. </s><s n="s6.6;p3.4">Here the rhyme scheme is itself 'disorientated'. </s></p><p n="p4.4"><s n="s1.5;p4.4">One sees interesting parallels with the work of Seamus Heaney in his poem 'Digging'. </s><s n="s2.5;p4.4">Both poets take themselves and the reader on a journey of self-identification, and begin to question their work or profession. </s><s n="s3.5;p4.4">Both relate to their families, and use figurative language to help describe their thoughts or inspirations. </s><s n="s4.5;p4.4">Heaney's thoughts are considered to be <hi rend="italic">'good turf'.</hi> </s><s n="s5.5;p4.4">It is also interesting to see how both poems begin with a fairly negative tone, but reach the conclusion that they are proud of their work as poets. </s></p></div1></body><back/></text></TEI.2>
