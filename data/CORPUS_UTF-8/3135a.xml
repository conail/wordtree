above him, giving an accurate depiction of Ainu life, which spans 150 years. </s><s n="s2.7;p1.6">Although the book is a personal portrayal of Kayano's life it is also, due to the context, a historical account of the indigenous people of northern Japan and demonstrates how, as a nation, they were stripped of their land, culture and identity by the Japanese. </s><s n="s3.7;p1.6">Kayano gives the reader an insight into his life as an Ainu who lives a life of submission to the Japanese's 'government policies of relocation and assimilation aimed at the eventual extinction of the Ainu'<ref target="BAWE_3135a-ftnote.001"/> (Siddle: 1997: 17). </s><s n="s4.7;p1.6">He then undergoes a 'cultural rebirth' where he realizes the importance of fighting for the preservation of his fading Ainu identity. </s><s n="s5.7;p1.6">Having been empowered by his culture Kayano goes on to become a leading activist against the extinction of the Ainu heritage, and his election as the first Ainu into the Japanese Diet demonstrates the strength of his determination. </s><s n="s6.7;p1.6">The book illustrates that 'the dying people (<hi rend="italic">horobiyuku minzoku</hi>)'<ref target="BAWE_3135a-ftnote.002"/> (Honda: 1993: xxiv) are still very much culturally alive and resisting Japanese attempts to make them 'totally assimilated or biologically extinct." </s><ref

writing style: the book is autobiographical and written by an Ainu which immediately creates a sense of cultural accuracy, and we feel we are getting insight into information that could not be achieved if written by an 'outsider'. </s><s n="s2.4;p2.6">Kayano, as an 'insider', 'offers a living testimonial to the history, ethos, customs, beliefs, hopes, and aspirations'<ref

inclined, to believe the information he presents. </s><s n="s3.4;p2.6">In addition to this, by using a first person narrative Kayano creates a more intimate atmosphere, and a stronger author-reader connection is established. </s><s n="s4.4;p2.6">Due to this connection Kayano has created, he 'draws us into the world of the Ainu'<ref target="BAWE_3135a-ftnote.006"/> (Hane: 1980, 1994: xi), increasing the empathy that his readers feel and successfully achieves one of his primary aims - to create sympathy and support for the Ainu's cause. </s></p><note place="foot"

Nibutani Valley. </s><s n="s3.7;p3.6">The book is opened with images of nature, which Kayano repeats extensively throughout the book- '...the mountains off in the distance from Nibutani, the running

desired aims, interestingly, the above techniques could also be seen to be detrimental in attaining his ambitions. </s></p><p n="p5.6"><s n="s1.9;p5.6">As I previously mentioned, the fact that Kayano is Ainu works in his favour, but only to a certain degree. </s><s n="s2.9;p5.6">This is also a negative element of the book, as due to Kayano's social and political context the reader is not given a balanced perspective, in this 'unabashedly partisan portrayal of the Ainu people's history." </s><ref target="BAWE_3135a-ftnote.012"/><s n="s3.9;p5.6">(Howell: 1993: xii) He has total control of constructing and presenting images and portrayals of people. </s><s n="s4.9;p5.6">For example, throughout the entire book he portrays the Ainu 'as passive victims of Japanese aggression'<ref target="BAWE_3135a-ftnote.013"/> (Howell: 1993: xii) and fails to mention acts of Ainu-led violence like Shakushain's War of 1669, which would not have supported the image he wanted to depict. </s><s n="s5.9;p5.6">The repetition of the natural imagery could also be another example of this. </s><s n="s6.9;p5.6">Kayano uses it to create an idyllic and harmonious image of Hokkaido and also the Ainu people. </s><s n="s7.9;p5.6">However, the extensive repetition could be considered romanticizing and over-exaggerating. </s><s n="s8.9;p5.6">Once again, no Japanese viewpoint is put across, therefore a balanced perspective is unattainable. </s><s n="s9.9;p5.6">The chance that the author may be over-exaggerating and choosing to exclude certain information because of his desire to favour his own cause, is something that the reader needs to bear in mind. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_3135a-ftnote.012"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.3;pn1.1">Howell, David in Honda, Katsuichi. </s><s

remember Kayano's key concern- making the reader feel empathetic for Ainu people, because if this were not achieved, the chance of gaining more support would be unlikely. </s><s n="s2.5;p6.6">The descriptive over-exaggerations, although they may be slightly misleading, are necessary in achieving his aim, because writing a 'dispassionate study of the Ainu'<ref target="BAWE_3135a-ftnote.014"/> (Honda: 1993: xiii) would dilute the strength, influence and power that the book holds. </s><s n="s3.5;p6.6">The book 'Our Land Was A Forest' sold extremely successfully in Japanese, so much so that it was translated into English and French to enable Kayano's message to reach a wider audience. </s><s n="s4.5;p6.6">Since the publication of the book, Kayano Shigeru has become 'a leading figure in the Ainu campaign for human rights, cultural preservation and recognition as indigenous people'<ref target="BAWE_3135a-ftnote.015"/> (Siddle: 1994) and has raised much awareness and support for the
