just have been slipping across the liquid rather than moving it, as the slow spindle head was not enough to move the strong cross links in the liquid. </s></p><p n="p20.34"><s n="s1.3;p20.34">I think that the 1% guar gum is not a Newtonian fluid because the viscosity changed with speed. </s><s n="s2.3;p20.34">As with the glycerol, the spindle may have been slipping across the strong crosslinking at slow speeds. </s><s n="s3.3;p20.34">Towards the end of the experiment, at between 1.5 RPM and 0.3 RPM at decreasing speeds, the strong crosslinking may have began to be broken, giving a high
