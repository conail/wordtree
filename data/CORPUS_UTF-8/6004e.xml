determined to be -0.53ºC and -0.49ºC respectively. </s><s n="s2.3;p40.41">These figures show the freezing point of the samples and show a slight increase in freezing point for the pasteurized skim milk. </s><s n="s3.3;p40.41">This is likely to be due to there being higher water content in the treated milk, as fat has been removed. </s></p><p n="p41.41"><s n="s1.2;p41.41">The processes of pasteurisation, separation and homogenisation are detailed and there are many aspects to examine in the final products. </s><s n="s2.2;p41.41">The changes and effects the processes cause are important
