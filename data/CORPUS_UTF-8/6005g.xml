ingredient and replace it with palm oil. </s><s n="s2.4;p1.9">This was because the price of coconut oil was too high and palm oil was a cheaper alternative. </s><s n="s3.4;p1.9">However, palm oil has a faster rate of oxidation than coconut oil and so we needed to investigate how to store the oil and how long we could keep it. </s><s n="s4.4;p1.9">The way to do this would be to obtain a peroxide value over life. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined">TASK</head><p n="p2.9"><s n="s1.1;p2.9">My task was to make it possible for daily samples to be tested for a peroxide value

palm oil supplier with details of our objectives and situation. </s><s n="s4.7;p4.9">I was then put in contact with the correct person who I spoke with on the telephone. </s><s n="s5.7;p4.9">This way we were able to get the information we needed more quickly <hi rend="italic">(Communication)</hi>. </s><s n="s6.7;p4.9">The supplier was able to do the testing so I then asked for details on how to

which tanks the palm oil was being put in to. </s><s n="s5.6;p5.9">I also requested that they left one of the tanks until last before the oil in it was used. </s><s n="s6.6;p5.9">I received
