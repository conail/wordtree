Whitley, 2004: 197; Kalogerakou, 1999: 97; Halstead, 1994: 203, 206). </s><s n="s4.6;p8.43">Thus, the House of Tiles no longer constitutes an example of early complexity as Renfew supports in his "Emergence of Civilisation" but a location for occasional gatherings (Peperaki, 2004: 214-215, 226). </s><s n="s5.6;p8.43">Similarly, the recently discovered EHII apsidal three-roomed house at Thebes, with outdoor pithoi and monumental walls, provides evidence for communal foci and labour mobilisation within a kin-based society (Aravantinos, 2004: 1255, 1258). </s><s n="s6.6;p8.43">The lack of consensus regarding the function of EH II corridor houses (Dickinson, 1994: 59;

Rutter, 2001: 154). </s><s n="s2.3;p11.43">It would appear that the EHIII-MHIII fortifications at Kolonna with their intricate gate layouts exemplify a unique style different from the later Cyclopean technique (Field, 1985: 150; Niemeier, 1995: 74-75; Rutter, 2001: 126). </s><s n="s3.3;p11.43">Although Niemeier (1995:76) rightly postulates that these impressive fortifications required considerable planning and organisation, there is no reason to assume that only a state society could achieve their construction. </s></p><p n="p12.43"><s n="s1.7;p12.43">The individual buried in the MHI Shaft Grave at Kolonna must have had a special status given the golden diadem worn on the head and the fact that except for the knife the rest of the grave goods have no stylistic parallels elsewhere (Kilian-Dirlmeier, 1997: 66, 68, 71). </s><s n="s2.7;p12.43">If these grave goods (Figure 1, Plate 1) are stylistically distinct they could have been made exclusively for this individual. </s><s n="s3.7;p12.43">It is possible that the riches in this grave reflect the isolated presence of a local leader without necessarily denoting established and sustained social stratification. </s><s n="s4.7;p12.43">The Shaft Grave was deliberately located just outside the fortification (ensuring visibility for those inside and outside the wall) and the burial was on ground that was not soft and unsuitable to digging. </s><s n="s5.7;p12.43">There were no other internments nearby and subsequent works on the walls did not affect the Shaft Grave (Kilian-Dirlmeier, 1995: 50; Kilian-Dirlmeier, 1997: 67-68, 72). </s><s n="s6.7;p12.43">Therefore, this grave may have acted more like a commemoration monument rather than an indicator of class-society <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>. </s><s n="s7.7;p12.43">The recent discovery of a <hi rend="italic">Großsteinbau</hi> made from thick walls could be contemporary to the Shaft Grave (Felten and Hiller, 2004: 13), but there is no further evidence to substantiate Felten's (2005: 11) suggestion that it served as the residence of a local leader. </s></p><p n="p13.43"><s n="s1.5;p13.43">Although the large pithoi from Kolonna probably stored agricultural produce (Rutter, 2001: 130), it remains questionable whether surplus was centrally organised. </s><s n="s2.5;p13.43">Rutter (2001: 125, 145) has emphasised that there was large-scale specialised pottery production and export (Gold Mica ware) but the exact production site remains to be found. </s><s n="s3.5;p13.43">In the absence of any modern regional survey and fabric/clay analysis the existence of multiple production sites around the island cannot be ruled out. </s><s n="s4.5;p13.43">As Hope Simpson (1981: 32-33) reports, in the early twentieth century Furtwängler located three other sites with Mycenaean pottery far away from Kolonna whose exact dating is unfortunately imprecise. </s><s n="s5.5;p13.43">There is also no apparent reason to associate Aegina's participation in numerous trade networks, as indicted by a plethora of Minoan and Cycladic pottery (Voutsaki, 1993: 67, 156), with central authorities controlling this trade. </s></p><p n="p14.43"><s n="s1.7;p14.43">The MHIII-LHI Shaft Graves at Mycenae have been a subject of immense fascination. </s><s n="s2.7;p14.43">Schliemann's mask of Agamemnon has become "one of the most widely recognized icons of the Aegean Bronze Age" (Dickinson, 2005: 299). </s><s n="s3.7;p14.43">The deposition of wealth at Mycenae aimed to legitimise property rights and hence strengthen social stratification (Voutsaki, 1997: 44). </s><s n="s4.7;p14.43">However, it is possible to disagree with Voutsaki's (1997: 36-37) critique of a Marxist-driven association between labour input and the value of the objects in the Shaft Graves, because as Chapman (2005: 94) argues labour investment is integral to the initial ascription of value of an artefact. </s><s n="s5.7;p14.43">Wolpert (2004: 129) disputes the existence of an established ideological framework that made prestige items in the Shaft Graves socially important. </s><s n="s6.7;p14.43">The question that arises here is how much ideological legitimacy is required to justify the presence of such excessive riches, especially when the mechanism of production and acquisition of the Shaft Grave artefacts is still not well understood (Chapman, 2005: 94). </s><s n="s7.7;p14.43">It remains uncertain whether a local or external supply of prestige items was centrally organised. </s></p><p n="p15.43"><s n="s1.6;p15.43">Arguments that the Shaft Grave individuals show class-consciousness (Graziadio, 1991: 406, 412) marking a transcendence from kinship society (Voutsaki, 1998: 44) can be contested. </s><s n="s2.6;p15.43">Facial reconstructions of the individuals buried in Circle B (Figure 2, Plate 2) revealed that skulls from the same grave show family likeness (Musgrave <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 1995: 129-130). </s><s n="s3.6;p15.43">If the kinship ties between the individuals buried in grave Γ and those buried in A and Γ (Musgrave <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 1995: 118) can be confirmed by DNA analysis (Brown <hi rend="italic">et al,</hi> 2003: 497), then the correlation between family and wealth becomes particularly intriguing. </s><s n="s4.6;p15.43">This is because grave Γ is exceptionally rich (Voutsaki, 1997: 41). </s><s n="s5.6;p15.43">What may be extrapolated from these elites is that kinship rather than class mattered to the society. </s><s n="s6.6;p15.43">Furthermore, in view of extensive grave-reuse and concerns about lineage, Wolpert (2004: 132, 135-136) rightly questions whether status had replaced kinship as a societal structuring principle. </s></p><p n="p16.43"><s n="s1.4;p16.43">Although the osteological material is fragile and in poor condition, the larger physique and better health of the Shaft Grave individuals (Musgrave <hi rend="italic">et al,</hi> 1995: 131-134;
