in Semillon it gives a strong grassy note. </s><s n="s3.5;p5.8">Heavy rains near maturity can cause berries to burst due to rapid water absorption across the grape skin. </s><s n="s4.5;p5.8">In Bordeaux, where the climate is temperate, the moment at which the best or worst climatic conditions occur has a greater influence on grape quality than absolute temperature or total rainfall. </s><s n="s5.5;p5.8">(Ribéreau-Gayon, 2000) </s></p><p n="p6.8"><s n="s1.3;p6.8">The soil, directly affects the development of the root system and consequently the vine water and mineral supplies. </s><s n="s2.3;p6.8">Being a natrophic plant, the vine accumulates little sodium, providing a level of resistance in salty soils. </s><s n="s3.3;p6.8">The table below indicates approximate ranges of nutrients needed by grapevines (Jackson, 1994): </s></p><table id="BAWE_6012c-tab.001"><row><cell/></row></table><p n="p7.8"><s n="s1.6;p7.8">The soil in the Graves appellation is mainly gravel, limiting the growth of other vegetation, however the roots of the vines are able to seek out the lenses of clay, silt and dirty sand, that are interbedded and hold moisture and mineral nutrients, key to the successful growth of vines such as Semillon. </s><s n="s2.6;p7.8">Water drains rapidly through gravel and coarse sand, but the lenticular stratum within the mound slows the downward movement of water, storing it in pores for later use. </s><s n="s3.6;p7.8">This is critical to the conservation of water, in an area were irrigation is not permitted (Wilson, 1998). </s><s n="s4.6;p7.8">Rootstock, plant density, trellising methods, vine management and disease also affect maturation, and therefore quality. </s><s n="s5.6;p7.8">Semillon is notably vulnerable to bunch rot and fanleaf degeneration. </s><s n="s6.6;p7.8">(Jackson, 1994) </s></p><p n="p8.8"><s n="s1.9;p8.8">A maximum sugar concentration without loss of berry weight indicates the completion of maturation. </s><s n="s2.9;p8.8">In Bordeaux, Semillon must have 176g of sugar per litre, below which, the wine has a vegetal aroma, and an optimum acidity at time of harvest of 4-5g/l; correlates to ideal maturity. </s><s n="s3.9;p8.8">The best terroirs for making aromatic dry white wines allow slow and complete maturation. </s><s n="s4.9;p8.8">In a climate, which is too cold, maturation is not sufficient; in a climate, which is too warm, the increase in sugar concentration may result in premature harvest, before other grape constituents are fully mature. </s><s n="s5.9;p8.8">The personality of dry white wine is due to varietal expression and its particular aromatic profile, resulting from a given terroir. </s><s n="s6.9;p8.8">When producing sweet wines, Semillon must obtain 12-13% potential alcohol and have a pH of less than 3.2 before any fungal development. </s><s n="s7.9;p8.8">The development of noble rot requires a particular climate, ideally with morning fogs to assure fungal growth, followed by warm afternoon sunshine to concentrate the grapes for relatively long period of 2-4 weeks. </s><s n="s8.9;p8.8">In Bordeaux vineyards, this corresponds to the establishment of a high-pressure ridge extending the anticyclone from the Azores to the north-east (Ribéreau-Gayon, 2000). </s><s n="s9.9;p8.8">In 2001, Sauternes benefited from an Indian summer, producing wines with great potential (Spurrier, 2002). </s></p></div1></body><back><div1 type="bibliography"><head rend="bold italic">References</head><p>Jackson R S (1994) <hi rend="italic">Wine Science: Principles and Applications</hi>.
