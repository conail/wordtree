hence one of the reasons to preserve the Tamworth is that it would more benefit from a niche market due to its high quality meat. </s></p><p n="p6.12"><s n="s1.7;p6.12">Another reason is that the Tamworth is exceptionally good at being reared on pastures. </s><s n="s2.7;p6.12">It has a long snout which means it is very good at clearing an area, especially woodland. </s><s n="s3.7;p6.12">It is an ideal animal for any gardener who wants their land cleared. </s><s n="s4.7;p6.12">Being a descendant of the Old English Forest Pig means they suit rough woodlands and forests. </s><s n="s5.7;p6.12">They are a disease resistant pig and can cope with extreme temperatures. </s><s n="s6.7;p6.12">Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI's) have been created for Conservation measures for these pigs. </s><s n="s7.7;p6.12">In which they graze on environmental areas such as National Parks and Nature Reserves. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_6027c-pic.002"/><p n="p7.12"><s n="s1.2;p7.12">The photo above shows woodland cleared by Tamworth pigs. </s><s n="s2.2;p7.12">The pigs are extremely happy to live outside and be able to wander freely throughout brambles and bracken in which they remove by grazing. </s></p><p n="p8.12"><s n="s1.4;p8.12">Another reason for saving this breed is that cross breeding can occur. </s><s n="s2.4;p8.12">In the 18 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century, most breeds were crossed with others, however the Tamworth was not, hence it is known as a pure breed. </s><s n="s3.4;p8.12">Today, the Tamworth is used to cross with other breeds such as the Berkshire, in order to produce good quality meat. </s><s n="s4.4;p8.12">Some breeds do not produce exceptionally good meat, so by crossing them with a Tamworth they benefit much better. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined bold">Survival</head><p n="p9.12"><s n="s1.7;p9.12">Tamworth Pigs have so many reasons and benefits as to why they should be saved and kept alive. </s><s n="s2.7;p9.12">How they are saved is the question though. </s><s n="s3.7;p9.12">DNA testing save and safe guarding existing genetics and developing a breeding strategy are all possibilities. </s><s n="s4.7;p9.12">Technology still needs to be developed so that the freezing of semen, embryos and tissues can be improved, in order to save certain breeds like the Tamworth. </s><s n="s5.7;p9.12">The Rare Breed Survival Trust (RBST), which was established in 1973, has ensured that no British farm animal has been wiped out and the Trust relies heavily on donations to carry out its work. </s><s n="s6.7;p9.12">Rare Breed Farms are found in the UK and are essential in order to preserve and maintain these rare breeds. </s><s n="s7.7;p9.12">Kentwell Hall, in Long Melford, Suffolk has a Rare Breed Farm in which Tamworth pigs are kept and looked after. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_6027c-pic.003"/><p n="p10.12"><s n="s1.4;p10.12">In 1978, Kentwell received its first Tamworth Pigs and have bred them ever since. </s><s n="s2.4;p10.12">Places such as Kentwell Hall, are essential in order to preserve Rare Breeds, such as the Tamworth Pig. </s><s n="s3.4;p10.12">Thousands of visitors arrive each year and this also helps to promote the rare breeds and prove how important it is to conserve them so they do not go extinct. </s><s n="s4.4;p10.12">This is an example of commercially exploiting a rare breed like the Tamworth. </s></p><p n="p11.12"><s n="s1.5;p11.12">The market is extremely important for rare breeds because it is here that will decide the fluctuations of the population. </s><s n="s2.5;p11.12">The Tamworth is a rare breed partly because it can not keep up with market needs, therefore it has become rare. </s><s n="s3.5;p11.12">Today, supermarkets require specific conditions so many breeds suffer. </s><s n="s4.5;p11.12">So, in 1994, The RBST created a scheme in which individual butchers' offer different breed meats so the consumer has a variety of tastes. </s><s n="s5.5;p11.12">An example of this is Powters Ltd, Newmarket, Suffolk. </s></p><p n="p12.12"><s n="s1.4;p12.12">In conclusion, The Tamworth pig is in danger and without Trusts and places such as The RBST and Kentwell Hall, the Tamworth maybe extinct. </s><s n="s2.4;p12.12">The Tamworth is now seen on an international scale, despite it being a rare breed. </s><s n="s3.4;p12.12">With its good quality meat, grazing benefits and cross breeding, the Tamworth is defiantly worth saving. </s><s n="s4.4;p12.12">It just needs more people and the market to realise what an important, yet efficient animal it is. </s></p></div1></body><back/></text></TEI.2>
