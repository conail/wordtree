INTRODUCTION</head><p n="p1.25"><s n="s1.6;p1.25">Discourse Analysis looks at language in terms of social interaction. </s><s n="s2.6;p1.25">According to Michael McCarthy (1991), "discourse analysis is a vast subject area within linguistics, encompassing [...] the analysis of spoken and written language over and above concerns such as the structure of the clause or sentence" (p. </s><s n="s3.6;p1.25">32). </s><s n="s4.6;p1.25">However, this paper focuses only on written discourse by analysing a text based on two main approaches: cohesion and thematization. </s><s n="s5.6;p1.25">Particularly, the discussion begins with a brief outline of the context of the sample, followed by an exposition of the two approaches based on background literature. </s><s n="s6.6;p1.25">Then, it moves on to a detailed analysis of the text and finally concludes with the limitations of the analysis. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">B. CONTEXT OF DISCOURSE</head><p n="p2.25"><s n="s1.1;p2.25">To begin with, the features that are important with regards to the context of discourse are the following: channel, formality, purpose, relationship between the addressor and the addressee, topic and setting. </s></p><p n="p3.25"><s n="s1.2;p3.25">Here, the channel is written and has the form of a formal letter including the addresses' full address, the date, and the formulaic opening and closing expressions: "Dear Mr Miller" and "Yours Sincerely". </s><s n="s2.2;p3.25">However, it is a genuine charity letter signed by a well-known game show host celebrity, aiming to personalize it and sensitise the addressee to provide financial help to the leukaemic children. </s></p><p n="p4.25"><s n="s1.4;p4.25">What is striking about its format is that it has a title and a subtitle accompanied by a visual image of two children. </s><s n="s2.4;p4.25">The title is in bold letters that easily catch the reader's attention, whereas the words "children" and "leukaemia" are capitalized, stressing the children's difficult state. </s><s n="s3.4;p4.25">The subtitle "inaugurated by Princess" gives value to those people's work and the phrase "no 298405" reveals that it is really a general letter sent to many people, yet easy to become personalized by the addition of the addressee's name. </s><s n="s4.4;p4.25">Finally, the names given in the right column, as well as the "P.S." and the sketch next to the signature add to the letter's general purpose of persuasion. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">C. LITERATURE REVIEW-COHESION</head><p n="p5.25"><s n="s1.2;p5.25">This part of the paper presents a literary review of the first approach, followed by a justification for its selection. </s><s n="s2.2;p5.25">It then concludes with the analysis of the text. </s></p><p n="p6.25"><s n="s1.7;p6.25">There are many texts that, although they are grammatically correct, are not cohesive. </s><s n="s2.7;p6.25">Such texts lack connectivity between sequences and so readers face difficulty in deciphering their meaning. </s><s n="s3.7;p6.25">As McCarthy (1991) supports, "English offers a [...] set of options for creating surface links between the clauses and sentences of a text otherwise known as cohesion" (p. </s><s n="s4.7;p6.25">25). </s><s n="s5.7;p6.25">In addition, Halliday and Hasan's (1976) system (as cited in Hatch, 1992, p. 223) "distinguishes five major types of grammatical cohesive ties: reference, substitution, ellipsis, conjunction, and lexical ties." </s><s n="s6.7;p6.25">These ties as Brown and Yule (1983) acknowledge: "bind a text together" (p. </s><s n="s7.7;p6.25">191). </s></p><p n="p7.25"><s n="s1.11;p7.25">As Thompson (1996) points out, "reference is a set of grammatical recourses that allow the speaker to indicate whether something is being repeated from somewhere earlier in the text" (p. </s><s n="s2.11;p7.25">180). </s><s n="s3.11;p7.25">It is binary: "the first [...] is known as exophoric ('pointing outwards') whereas the second is anaphoric ('pointing inwards') (Thompson, 1996, p. 181). </s><s n="s4.11;p7.25">The second cohesive tie is ellipsis, where "a clause [...] may be presupposed at a subsequent place in the text by the device of positive omission" (Halliday, 1985, p. 288). </s><s n="s5.11;p7.25">The third, on the other hand, is substitution that takes place when "an expression may simply be replaced by another in the text" (Brown and Yule, 1983, p. 201). </s><s n="s6.11;p7.25">The fourth type of cohesive tie is conjunction. </s><s n="s7.11;p7.25">According to Hatch (1992), "here are several different kinds of conjunctive relations: additive [...], adversative [...], causal [...] and temporal" (p. </s><s n="s8.11;p7.25">225). </s><s n="s9.11;p7.25">The last type of cohesion is lexical cohesion. </s><s n="s10.11;p7.25">According to Brown and Yule (1983), "cohesion may be derived from lexical relationships like hyponymy [...], part-whole [...], collocability [...], clausal substitution [...], comparison [...] and by syntactic repetition" (p. </s><s n="s11.11;p7.25">194). </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">D. REASONS FOR CHOOSING COHESION</head><p n="p8.25"><s n="s1.5;p8.25">Before proceeding to the analysis of the text based on cohesion, it is necessary to mention the reasons for selecting it. </s><s n="s2.5;p8.25">Firstly, as it is clear by the pertinent review, many linguists have studied this approach and perceive it as one of the main approaches for analysing written discourse. </s><s n="s3.5;p8.25">Furthermore, cohesion offers an insight into the meaning relations between the various elements of a text, as knowledge of the grammatical relations between words is not enough. </s><s n="s4.5;p8.25">Finally, according to Halliday (1985), "in order to construct discourse we need to be able to establish [...] relations that may involve elements of any extent [...] (and) this cannot be achieved by grammatical structure" (p. </s><s n="s5.5;p8.25">288). </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">E.

SUBSTITUTION</head><p n="p12.25"><s n="s1.6;p12.25">Moving on to the second type of cohesion, substitution, one can trace in the text several entities that are replaced by others belonging to the same grammatical category. </s><s n="s2.6;p12.25">As Halliday (1985) suggests, "there are three main contexts for ellipsis and substitution in English. </s><s n="s3.6;p12.25">These are 1) the clause, 2) the verbal group and 3) the nominal group" (p. </s><s n="s4.6;p12.25">297). </s><s n="s5.6;p12.25">Hence, the phrase "do it" (l. </s><s n="s6.6;p12.25">8) replacing the verbal group in ll.7-8 "find the answers". </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="underlined bold">E.3. ELLIPSIS</head><p n="p13.25"><s n="s1.8;p13.25">Compared to the one example of substitution, instances of ellipsis are easily evident throughout the text. </s><s n="s2.8;p13.25">For example: "which" implied for 'questions' (l. </s><s n="s3.8;p13.25">2), "for which" for 'disease' (l. </s><s n="s4.8;p13.25">4). </s><s n="s5.8;p13.25">Instances of verbal groups such as "my friends [are working]" (l. </s><s n="s6.8;p13.25">7), "perhaps [will] a friend [...?]" (l.10) are also ellipses from the text. </s><s n="s7.8;p13.25">Though they are omitted, the reader can easily guess the meaning of the elliptical words. </s><s n="s8.8;p13.25">(For further examples see Appendix 1). </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="underlined bold">E.4. CONJUNCTION</head><p n="p14.25"><s n="s1.9;p14.25">The fourth type of cohesion is conjunction. </s><s n="s2.9;p14.25">This category includes logical connectors that help the writer to edit their text carefully. </s><s n="s3.9;p14.25">The connector "and" (l. </s><s n="s4.9;p14.25">5) adds more information to the sentence by referring to more than one element. </s><s n="s5.9;p14.25">The conjunction "but" (l. </s><s n="s6.9;p14.25">8) on the other hand, has the adversative role of showing that although people are trying hard, they cannot cure the disease. </s><s n="s7.9;p14.25">Also, "thanks to" (l. </s><s n="s8.9;p14.25">12) signifies a causal relationship between the two clauses. </s><s n="s9.9;p14.25">Finally, in lines 18-19 there is a causal - conditional relationship between Mr Miller's support of the addressor's appeal and the following result of ensuring the benefits of his actions. </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="underlined bold">E.5. LEXICAL COHESION</head><p n="p15.25"><s n="s1.15;p15.25">Finally, various types of lexical cohesion link the text together and create a unified whole. </s><s n="s2.15;p15.25">To begin with, several words are repeated: "found" (ll. </s><s n="s3.15;p15.25">5, 6) and "answers"(ll. </s><s n="s4.15;p15.25">13, 15). </s><s n="s5.15;p15.25">Also, the word "child-killer disease" (l. </s><s n="s6.15;p15.25">4) is used as a synonym for "leukaemia" (l. </s><s n="s7.15;p15.25">4). </s><s n="s8.15;p15.25">Although the verbs "receive" and "win" are not really synonymous, in this particular context they act as such, since both refer to "prizes". </s><s n="s9.15;p15.25">Another type of lexical cohesion is hyponymy, as in: "disease and leukaemia". </s><s n="s10.15;p15.25">Besides, a cohesion tie that most writers prefer to use in their texts is collocation. </s><s n="s11.15;p15.25">This refers to words that go together in a context and complement each other such as "question-answers" (ll. </s><s n="s12.15;p15.25">2, 3), or antonyms "seller and the buyer" (l. </s><s n="s13.15;p15.25">14). </s><s n="s14.15;p15.25">Consequently, lexical cohesion allows the writer to play with words and enrich his text. </s><s n="s15.15;p15.25">(For more reference see Appendix 1). </s></p><p n="p16.25"><s n="s1.3;p16.25">As a result, this section of the paper has looked at how cohesive devices connect ideas within the text. </s><s n="s2.3;p16.25">By now it is clear that the interpretation of one item is based on the understanding of another. </s><s n="s3.3;p16.25">The following part of the essay provides a literary review of thematization and examines its application in the text. </s></p></div2></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">F.

ANALYSIS OF TEXT - THEMATIZATION</head><p n="p21.25"><s n="s1.8;p21.25">The text is divided into four paragraphs. </s><s n="s2.8;p21.25">The theme of the first paragraph introduces the topic of the whole text. </s><s n="s3.8;p21.25">The phrase "life...show" (l.1) links the whole paragraph back to the concept of life with its unanswered questions that make us wonder. </s><s n="s4.8;p21.25">The first rheme, in addition, completes the theme by commenting on life's unexpected nature. </s><s n="s5.8;p21.25">In this rheme, there is a sub-theme "we" and a sub-rheme "still ... answers" (ll. </s><s n="s6.8;p21.25">2,3). </s><s n="s7.8;p21.25">The second sentence, however, has a more specific theme, which initiates the problem of leukaemia, whereas the rheme analyses its seriousness. </s><s n="s8.8;p21.25">Therefore, the writer makes a general comment by setting the frame of his topic and now moves on in its analysis. </s></p><p n="p22.25"><s n="s1.8;p22.25">In the second paragraph, in contrast, there is a change of topic from "life" to "I". </s><s n="s2.8;p22.25">Here, the addressor expresses his awareness that there are people who work hard to find a cure. </s><s n="s3.8;p22.25">The transition in the development of the text is very smooth and the clauses are nicely linked together. </s><s n="s4.8;p22.25">The first rheme, "my friends" (l. </s><s n="s5.8;p22.25">7) is picked up by the next theme, emphasizing people's work in that institute. </s><s n="s6.8;p22.25">Picked up theme as Lock (1996) claims, " is a thematized constituent [...] later picked up by a pronoun in an unmarked position in the clause" (p. </s><s n="s7.8;p22.25">227). </s><s n="s8.8;p22.25">The rheme following it, consisting of many sub-themes, comments on people's need for financial help. </s></p><p n="p23.25"><s n="s1.8;p23.25">In the third paragraph, and having stated the situation, the author moves on to explain the purpose of his letter. </s><s n="s2.8;p23.25">The theme introduces the topic of the paragraph, which is about persuading the addressee to sell the tickets. </s><s n="s3.8;p23.25">The rheme is part of an interrogative clause. </s><s n="s4.8;p23.25">Since it is a yes/no question, according to Halliday (1985), "the element that functions as Theme is the element that embodies the expression of polarity" (p. </s><s n="s5.8;p23.25">47). </s><s n="s6.8;p23.25">In addition, the next clause provides information about the prizes. </s><s n="s7.8;p23.25">The theme changes, whereas the rheme is picked up by the previous one. </s><s n="s8.8;p23.25">Finally, the paragraph ends with a complex clause, where theme and rheme are picked up from the previous clauses, emphasizing the writer's request. </s></p><p n="p24.25"><s n="s1.7;p24.25">In conclusion, the last paragraph states the benefits that will arise from selling the tickets. </s><s n="s2.7;p24.25">It starts with a picked up multiple theme, "By...you" (l. </s><s n="s3.7;p24.25">18), followed by a rheme: "will ensure...treatments" (ll. </s><s n="s4.7;p24.25">18-21) that expresses a causal-conditional relationship to it, and is later picked up by the next theme (l.21). </s><s n="s5.7;p24.25">Here, the letter reaches its conclusion. </s><s n="s6.7;p24.25">Thus, the writer manages to state the problem, develop his argumentation and express his request in a rather convincing way. </s><s n="s7.7;p24.25">(For further evidence see Appendix 2). </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">I. CONCLUSION</head><p n="p25.25"><s n="s1.6;p25.25">To sum up, the primary purpose of this paper was to examine how the two main approaches of written discourse (cohesion and thematization) shed light on the way discourse works. </s><s n="s2.6;p25.25">However, there is another related approach to discourse analysis that this paper does not refer to, called clause relationships. </s><s n="s3.6;p25.25">This approach constitutes a first limitation of this study. </s><s n="s4.6;p25.25">A second limitation is that thematization brought up several difficulties in identifying the theme and rheme of each clause. </s><s n="s5.6;p25.25">The instances were not always clear-cut and thus allowed for various interpretations. </s><s n="s6.6;p25.25">However, besides these limitations, this paper leads to future study of other approaches of discourse analysis and the possible pedagogic implications these carry. </s></p></div1></body><back><div1 type="bibliography"><head rend="bold">J.
