we, by not destroying you, would be able to profit from you" (Thuc. </s><s n="s8.9;p2.14">5.93). </s><s n="s9.9;p2.14">Therefore we can see that the Peloponnesian War placed a heavy burden on the Athenian economy, which led to Athens' increasingly brutal treatment of its allies in order to secure their tribute payments. </s></p><p n="p3.14"><s n="s1.8;p3.14">The economic effects of the war were also directly felt by the Athenian population. </s><s n="s2.8;p3.14">Aristophanes referred to rising prices in Athens in a line from <hi rend="italic">The Frogs</hi>, where Dionysus, upon being told to pay the ferryman's fare, remarks that it is "amazing what you can get for two obels these days" (Ar. </s><s n="s3.8;p3.14"><hi rend="italic">Frogs</hi> pp. 161).<ref target="BAWE_6053c-ftnote.001"/> The ferryman's fare was traditionally one obel, so we can see this quote as a reflection of how prices were increasing in Athens during the war. </s><s n="s4.8;p3.14">This was because Athens had to increasingly rely on imports due to the occupation of her land by Sparta (Thuc. </s><s n="s5.8;p3.14">7.28), which had decreased the supply of produce to the city. </s><s n="s6.8;p3.14">The effect of this was intensified since "the mass of the people had had little enough to start with and had now been deprived of even that; the richer classes had lost their fine estates" (Thuc. </s><s n="s7.8;p3.14">2.65). </s><s n="s8.8;p3.14">Therefore the economic gap between the Athenian rich and poor became larger. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_6053c-ftnote.001"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">All references to Aristophanes will be given the abbreviation Ar. </s></p></note><p n="p4.14"><s n="s1.6;p4.14">The large gap between the rich and poor in turn caused the war to have political effects on Athens. </s><s n="s2.6;p4.14">Osbourne has pointed out that "long invasions created internal pressures, partly because they did not affect all those alike... and partly because in a city under siege there was considerable scope for treacherous action and suspicion of treachery" (Osbourne 1987: 142).<ref target="BAWE_6053c-ftnote.002"/> As time went on and the gap between rich and poor widened, political tensions developed between the two groups, with the poor backing a democracy while many of the rich favoured an oligarchy. </s><s n="s3.6;p4.14">Thucydides remarked that "society had become divided into two ideologically hostile camps, and each side viewed the other with suspicion" (Thuc. </s><s n="s4.6;p4.14">3.83). </s><s n="s5.6;p4.14">Austin has provided evidence for this split by pointing out that the revolution of the Thirty was mainly backed by wealthy citizens (Austin 1980: 140). </s><s n="s6.6;p4.14">Therefore, although this division between democracy and oligarchy had existed before the war, we can see that the Peloponnesian War helped to intensify the split between the two groups and create a divided city. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_6053c-ftnote.002"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Cited in Foxhall 1993: 143 </s></p></note><p n="p5.14"><s n="s1.10;p5.14">The split between democrats and oligarchs was did not stay as a purely ideological conflict, since it was to lead to real consequences. </s><s n="s2.10;p5.14">Thucydides tells us that many Athenians feared a revolution which would overthrow the democracy, and thus "they were consequently always in a state of fear and apt to look at everything suspiciously" (Thuc. </s><s n="s3.10;p5.14">6.53). </s><s n="s4.10;p5.14">This led to politicians accusing those who stood in their way to the top of plotting to overthrow the democracy in order to stir up public opinion against them. </s><s n="s5.10;p5.14">For example, Thucydides tells us that Alcibiades was accused of mutilating the Hermae in Athens because his political enemies were able to use this as evidence of a plot to overthrow the democracy (Thuc. </s><s n="s6.10;p5.14">6.28), and were so successful that Alcibiades was forced to abandon the city (Thuc. </s><s n="s7.10;p5.14">6.61). </s><s n="s8.10;p5.14">Another example that shows how the Peloponnesian War created an atmosphere of fear in Athens is the trial of Socrates. </s><s n="s9.10;p5.14">Guthrie has argued that Socrates was tried due to his connections with the oligarchic Thirty, and thus the restored democrats "could not feel safe until he was out of the way" (Guthrie 1969: 381). </s><s n="s10.10;p5.14">Therefore we can see that the Peloponnesian War caused Athens to become a suspicious, politically divided society in fear of revolution. </s></p><p n="p6.14"><s n="s1.7;p6.14">The trial of Socrates can also be used to show the effect the Peloponnesian War had on religion in Athens. </s><s n="s2.7;p6.14">Guthrie says that the charge brought against Socrates, that of impiety, was not just a simple cover for political motives but actually carried some weight of its own. </s><s n="s3.7;p6.14">For example, his links with Critias (an atheist) and Alcibiades (who was suspected of sacrilege in regard to the Hermae mentioned above) were good grounds for a case of impiety in the court (Guthrie 1969: 383). </s><s n="s4.7;p6.14">Dodds makes a valid claim that the reason for this new intolerant attitude to impiety can be put down to war hysteria, because "to offend the gods... was risky enough in peacetime; but in war it was practically treason - it amounted to helping the enemy" (Dodds 1951: 191). </s><s n="s5.7;p6.14">Dodds also mentions that other notable intellectuals, such as Diagoras, Anaxagoras and possibly Euripides, were also prosecuted for religious offences during the war for their progressive views (Dodds 1951: 189). </s><s n="s6.7;p6.14">In my opinion this was because Athenians feared that impious behaviour by individuals would cause the city to lose the gods' favour, which would in turn lead to defeat. </s><s n="s7.7;p6.14">Therefore an intolerant attitude was shown to people whose impiety had previously been allowed. </s></p><p n="p7.14"><s n="s1.5;p7.14">The Peloponnesian War also indirectly gave a boost to Athenian religion through the plague. </s><s n="s2.5;p7.14">The population density of Athens was greatly increased due to people moving from the countryside and taking protection inside the city, and this in turn was partly responsible for the spread of the plague that occurred in 430 BC. Parker has argue that "in a sense the plague strengthened the faith of the Athenians, if it is right to see, for instance, the purification of Delos and the introduction of Asclepius as responses to it" (Parker 1996: 200). </s><s n="s3.5;p7.14">Asclepius was a healing god who originated in Epidaurus. </s><s n="s4.5;p7.14">Before the plague he was a minor deity who was not a part of Athenian religion, yet after the plague he became a major figure of worship and was adopted into Athenian religion. </s><s n="s5.5;p7.14">Therefore we can see that, because of the intensity of the plague that was due to the Peloponnesian War, Athenian society turned to a new god, thus the Peloponnesian War helped to alter Athenian religious practice. </s></p><p n="p8.14"><s n="s1.11;p8.14">The Peloponnesian War also led to a number of theatrical works being produced that took the effects of the war on Athens as a major theme, since poets carried a dual role in Athens, "to amuse... citizens, and to advise" (Ar. </s><s n="s2.11;p8.14"><hi rend="italic">Frogs</hi> p.181). </s><s n="s3.11;p8.14">The problems caused by the war gave the poets a number of issues to rise in their plays and encourage debate about. </s><s n="s4.11;p8.14">The plays of Aristophanes in particular discussed the war and its various effects. </s><s n="s5.11;p8.14">One theme that occurs in Aristophanes' comedies is an opposition to leading politicians and the conduct of Athenian politics in general. </s><s n="s6.11;p8.14">Many leading democrats who turn down peace in favour of war are personally named and taunted in Aristophanes' work. </s><s n="s7.11;p8.14">For example, in <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi> Kleon, a democrat who had urged the Assembly to vote in favour of massacring and enslavement of the population of Mytilene, is likened to a pestle "who churned up all Greece" (Ar. </s><s n="s8.11;p8.14"><hi rend="italic">Peace</hi> p.29). </s><s n="s9.11;p8.14">Another example of this is the attack on Archedemus, a democrat who argued in favour of the execution of the Arginusae generals, whom Aristophanes remarks that "among the dead men he's the prince of crooks - it's the way they do things now" (Ar. </s><s n="s10.11;p8.14"><hi rend="italic">Frogs</hi> p.172). </s><s n="s11.11;p8.14">Therefore we can see how Aristophanes took a negative stance to the leading politicians of the day. </s></p><p n="p9.14"><s n="s1.3;p9.14">Aristophanes also expressed a wish for peace and unity amongst the Greeks, both of which were lacking due to the war. </s><s n="s2.3;p9.14">As well as attacking men who pursued the war, the play <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi> is all about the struggle of a group of Greeks who try to save the goddess Peace from War. </s><s n="s3.3;p9.14">The disunity between Greeks that had resulted in the oligarchic coup of the Thirty and which I have written about above prompted Aristophanes to write the lines: </s></p><quote lang="English"><hi rend="italic">'Tis history now- their folly they regret;
