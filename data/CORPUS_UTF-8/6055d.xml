plosive sounds should be tackled first before the fricatives and affricatives in coherence with the normal development sequence. </s><s n="s3.6;p15.28">Initial focus is placed in facilitating the production of sounds in isolation and then into simple nonsense CV syllables and followed by meaningful words. </s><s n="s4.6;p15.28">Further consonants of a similar group might be elicited through the first consonant acquired, for example, firstly acquired [ʃ] can be modified to produce [s]. </s><s n="s5.6;p15.28">Complexity of the phonetic context of target sound should be gradually increased, for example, practice / t / at the final position of the word as in 'hat' before going into initial position as in 'top' which requires additional aspiration component. </s><s n="s6.6;p15.28">Appropriate progression will strengthen the sensorimotor patterns and achieve desired modification of the child's Sound Pattern Template (Lancaster &amp;
