were deified upon their death. </s><s n="s6.6;p1.5">This essay will investigate whether the Romans believed their emperor to be a god, and will examine the beliefs present in the state and private cults. </s></p><p n="p2.5"><s n="s1.26;p2.5">The worship of the emperor varied greatly in the public and private spheres of Roman religion. </s><s n="s2.26;p2.5">The religions of Rome did not have a central governing body, such as a Papacy. </s><s n="s3.26;p2.5">As a result, religion was essentially divided into three main spheres, consisting of household, private and state. </s><s n="s4.26;p2.5">The top level of Roman religion was the State cult, which was funded by the empire and followed the rituals of the state cult in Rome. </s><s n="s5.26;p2.5">Each of these levels had their own considerations of the emperor's divinity, but 'the state cult recognized only the Divi imperators and the genius of the ruling emperor,'<ref target="BAWE_6073f-ftnote.001"/> whereas many private cults openly worshipped the emperor as a living god. </s><s n="s6.26;p2.5">It was considered problematic for the state to acknowledge the emperor as divine. </s><s n="s7.26;p2.5">Traditionally the emperor was first among equals within the senate, and as a result accepting him as a god would have implied that the emperor was clearly superior to every other senator. </s><s n="s8.26;p2.5">This would thereby have undermined the perceived status of the senate. </s><s n="s9.26;p2.5">As a result of this, 'the sinister connotations of the emperor's state divinity left only one option for clearer formulation of the imperial office in the Roman state: the <hi rend="italic"> Genius</hi> of the living emperor, a cult which did not imply divinity, but certainly did imply social humiliation for the senators involved." </s><ref target="BAWE_6073f-ftnote.002"/><s n="s10.26;p2.5">Although worship of the living emperor was frowned upon, it was considered correct to worship the living emperor's <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi>, which was 'closely attached to his person, though it was not entirely clear whether the Genius was perceived as dwelling within his body or outside it, as more of a guardian spirit." </s><ref target="BAWE_6073f-ftnote.003"/><s n="s11.26;p2.5">It was believed that every person, including the emperor, possessed a <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi>. </s><s n="s12.26;p2.5">Worship of the <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> constituted a large part of religious ritual, and was not specific to the emperor. </s><s n="s13.26;p2.5">For example, many people privately worshipped the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> of the owner of the household. </s><s n="s14.26;p2.5">The <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> was usually worshipped by slaves and freedmen, as they owed their living to the master of the household, and were considered <hi rend="italic">clientes,</hi> subordinate within the household, by law and tradition, to the power of the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi>. </s><s n="s15.26;p2.5">Similarly, the emperor's <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> could be worshipped as the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> of the Empire. </s><s n="s16.26;p2.5">Worship of the emperor's <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> in fact had several political benefits for the senators and important members of the Roman political system, as "the higher the emperor was placed on the status ladder of the world, the higher was the relative placement of the senators themselves; if the emperor possessed outright divine status, the role and self-esteem of prominent would be as good as in the old days." </s><ref target="BAWE_6073f-ftnote.004"/><s n="s17.26;p2.5">Worshipping the emperor's <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> thereby served a dual political purpose, avoiding giving ultimate power over Rome to this living deity whilst at the same time allowing the senators to gain improved approval from the emperor and increasing their status in the world. </s><s n="s18.26;p2.5">As the <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> was merely attached to the emperor, rather than making the emperor divine, this avoided some of the problems of offering the emperor full divinity. </s><s n="s19.26;p2.5">Conferring full divinity upon the emperor would have placed him far higher than his senators, whereas by worshipping the <hi rend="italic">Genius,</hi> it was the emperor's divine spirit, rather than the emperor himself, which was elevated. </s><s n="s20.26;p2.5">However, the worship of the <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> created its own problems within the social hierarchy. </s><s n="s21.26;p2.5">By worshipping the emperor's <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> as the paterfamilias of the Roman empire, the position of entire population of the empire, including the senators, would be reduced to that of <hi rend="italic">Clientes</hi>, no higher than the slaves and freedmen who worshipped the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> within the household. </s><s n="s22.26;p2.5">The position of the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> was almost monarchical, with great symbolic power attached, and so 'the time at which the living emperor's <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> began to receive state worship may thus be taken as the point where the Roman state formally acknowledged itself to be a monarchy." </s><ref target="BAWE_6073f-ftnote.005"/><s n="s23.26;p2.5">Although the worship of the emperor's <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> by the state cult did not necessarily have any practical implications, as it did not confer any powers on the emperor, it was a symbolic affirmation of the emperor's position within Rome. </s><s n="s24.26;p2.5">As can be seen, the state did not worship the living emperor as a god, due to the political implications. </s><s n="s25.26;p2.5">Instead, the only worship the emperor received was for his <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi>. </s><s n="s26.26;p2.5">However, this had its own problems, as it acknowledged the emperor's power, as <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> of the Roman empire, over his <hi rend="italic">clientes,</hi> the citizens and subjects of the empire.

target="BAWE_6073f-ftnote.010"/><s n="s10.25;p4.5">However, worship of the Divi Imperatores was not popular, as the emperor was of little importance once he had died. </s><s n="s11.25;p4.5">As a

target="BAWE_6073f-ftnote.011"/><s n="s12.25;p4.5">Although this would have created political problems within the state cult, this was not an issue for the private sphere, as the personal and private

worship of the emperor had social benefits for the members of a cult. </s><s n="s15.25;p4.5">Whereas the power of many of the gods found in modern religion is absolute, the position and power of the Roman gods was not strictly defined. </s><s n="s16.25;p4.5">As Ittai Gradel argues in Emperor Worship and Roman Religion, the position of the gods was relative, and followed a hierarchy, with no one god exercising absolute control over the other gods. </s><s n="s17.25;p4.5">The power and position of the gods was not set in a single document, such as the Bible for Christians or the Qu'ran for Muslims, allowing individuals to decide if an emperor was human or divine, and how powerful the divinities were. </s><s n="s18.25;p4.5">This opened up the prospect of hierarchical advancement within the divinities, with the emperor essentially able to claim he was more divine than his followers, as well as other gods, even if he could not claim powers equal to that of, for example, Jupiter. </s><s n="s19.25;p4.5">In turn, by placing the emperor higher in the divine hierarchy, the position of those who worshipped was also elevated, 'they therefore uniformly chose to place him on the superhuman level, deliberately and emphatically so." </s><ref target="BAWE_6073f-ftnote.012"/><s n="s20.25;p4.5">By worshipping the emperor as a living god, the members of the 'imperial cults' rose above the position of normal citizens or subjects. </s><s n="s21.25;p4.5">As a result, private cults would not merely worship the living Emperor's <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> or the <hi
