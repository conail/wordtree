praiseworthy god of all, and here particularly Catullus claims that it is because marriage is a natural outcome of love. </s><s n="s3.5;p3.22">Hymenaeus is the god who is desired most by the lovers, but notice that Catullus makes it clear that it is only the case for lovers who are also 'beloved'. </s><s n="s4.5;p3.22">Marriage requires an agreement from both parties, so marriage is not going to happen, or even if it happens it would not result in happy ending, unless there is 'two-way love' between a couple. </s><s n="s5.5;p3.22">This illustration is a sharp contrast with the situation Catullus is in, where there is an unfixable gap between Catullus as a lover and Lesbia as a beloved, and Catullus knows that he will never be able to become 'beloved' lover. </s></p><note place="foot"

away from her family and leads her to sacrifice her one and only unrecoverable flower, virginity, to her young man who is becoming like a 'savage' animal because of his sexual desire for her. </s><s n="s3.4;p4.22">In another translation, this feature of marriage illustrated more explicitly as Hymenaeus 'plucking the flower from the mother's lap'<ref target="BAWE_6076c-ftnote.008"/>. </s><s n="s4.4;p4.22">The Latin word <hi rend="italic">gremium</hi>, which is translated as bosom and lap by Godwin and Whigham respectively, could also mean 'womb', which might make this picture of the marriage god snatching a precious flower from her mother's womb more cruel and painful particularly for bride's parents. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_6076c-ftnote.008"><p n="pn1.1"><s

n="s2.3;p5.22">Loss of virginity itself may be seen as damage for a bride and her parents, but Venus, the mother of 'the spirits of love' Cupid, could derive benefits out of marriage and bless a couple if this plucking of flower is approved by Hymenaeus. </s><s n="s3.3;p5.22">In other words, the ideal form of marriage should involve a couple who love each other being united into one under the blessing and approval of the marriage god, from which Venus can extract a lot of benefits such as love, sexual pleasure and children. </s></p><p n="p6.22"><s n="s1.5;p6.22">This notion of 'proper' marriage reminds us of Catullus' poem LXX, where Catullus says his 'woman' said to him that there was no one who she would rather want to marry except Catullus, not even Jupiter. </s><s n="s2.5;p6.22">Some may argue that Catullus' main subject of this poem is changeability and cruel capriciousness of his beloved, but this short poem could also be seen as suggesting that Lesbia is violating Catullus' ideal marriage in almost every respect. </s><s n="s3.5;p6.22">Not only is Lesbia willing to betray her married husband by having an adulterous relationship with Catullus, but also presumably she had already had so many physical relationships with Catullus and other lovers when she made this statement. </s><s n="s4.5;p6.22">It is, therefore, very clear that her reason of marring Catullus is not at all to be physically united with him under the approval of the marriage god. </s><s n="s5.5;p6.22">The grief of Catullus is also expressed in his use of the word <hi rend="italic">mulier</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">puella</hi>, which shows that Catullus is well aware that the lady who is expressing her willingness to marry him is not a virgin girl but a wife of somebody else, whose marriage to Catullus would consequently never be either approved by Hymenaeus or blessed by Venus<ref target="BAWE_6076c-ftnote.009"/>. </s></p><note place="foot"

then could he reconcile his position as an adulterer with his belief of marriage as a fruit of pure love relationship and justify his love towards Lesbia? </s><s n="s2.3;p7.22">As we have noted already Catullus' view towards love relationship is never one-sided, and from the poem LXII onwards, in fact, Catullus shows us a lot of different examples of marriage, some of which worked very well and others ended up in a disaster. </s><s n="s3.3;p7.22">And roughly speaking, we could read two most significant reasons why quite a few marriage relations do not work and therefore Catullus could safely say his Love with Lesbia is justifiable. </s></p><p n="p8.22"><s n="s1.4;p8.22">Firstly, marriage is not purely about love, but it is also an important social institution. </s><s n="s2.4;p8.22">As Catullus points out in his poem LXI, marriage is essential in that it provides children who 'aged parents can lean on', and will be 'defending the borders' of their land. </s><s n="s3.4;p8.22">In other words, marriage is a basis for both the family and the country to be firmly established and to prosper. </s><s n="s4.4;p8.22">In the poem LXII, again Catullus let the chorus of young women, who argues that marriage takes away all the charms of a girl by beheading her flower of virginity, be defeated by the chorus of young men singing that keeping virginity is meaningless in that it neither matures nor 'brings forth a ripe grape'. </s></p><p n="p9.22"><s n="s1.3;p9.22">Ironically, though, because marriage is necessary for social stability, there are many examples of marriage out of necessity or convenience rather than as a result of love. </s><s n="s2.3;p9.22">Although Catullus does not deal with a direct example of marital failure of this sort, we can still read that Catullus highly respects marriage as ultimate love relationship and dismisses the notion of marriage as purely social necessity from the poem LXVI. Queen Berenice had to assassinate her first husband Demetrius, with whom her mother had fallen love and to whom her mother had forced her to marry, in order to get her true beloved King Ptolemy Euergetes as her husband<ref target="BAWE_6076c-ftnote.010"/>. </s><s n="s3.3;p9.22">And Catullus calls this deed 'brave', which put an end to both her mother's abnormal sexual relations to her son-in-law and her loveless marriage life, and expresses no negative assessment towards her murder of her ex-husband. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_6076c-ftnote.010"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Godwin, p.187 and Ellis, p. 299 </s></p></note><p n="p10.22"><s n="s1.2;p10.22">Secondly, Catullus shows us that 'fanatical devotion and despairing devotion' drive us into temporal madness and lead us to make a speed decision which we may regret after we come back to ourselves<ref target="BAWE_6076c-ftnote.011"/>. </s><s n="s2.2;p10.22">The two most obvious examples can be found in the poem LXIV and LXIII, the story of Ariadne who is deserted by her 'husband' Theseus, and of Attis who had 'irreversible marriage' to Cybele respectively. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_6076c-ftnote.011"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Ferguson, p. 34 </s></p></note><p n="p11.22"><s n="s1.2;p11.22">Ariadne, in the poem LXIV, fell in love with the handsome stranger at the first sight, provided him with a sword to kill the Minotaur and a thread to guide him out of the labyrinth, left all her family members who love her so much behind to follow her passionate love for Theseus, and eventually ended up with being abandoned just like Queen Dido or Medea. </s><s n="s2.2;p11.22">Attis, on the other hand, completely fascinated by the Mother Goddess Cybele, had emasculated himself to become one of the eunuch priest for her, and next morning when he recovered his conscious he grieved over his sexual identity which he had lost completely and would never be able to restore again. </s></p><p n="p12.22"><s n="s1.2;p12.22">Both situations described in the poems LXIV and LVIII not only do illustrate the possibility of unsuccessful marriage due to thoughtlessly made decisions and uncontrollable temporal passion, but also clearly reflect Catullus' own position to Lesbia in which Catullus devotes himself to his beloved madly, loses his masculinity completely, and gains nothing from it. </s><s n="s2.2;p12.22">On the one hand these illustrations of failures in marital relationship definitely help Catullus to justify himself of messing up Lesbia's marriage, but on the other they remark Catullus as a miserable and helpless man who is well aware of the fact that his Love with Lesbia would not produce any positive outcomes and still could not rescue himself out of this morass. </s></p><p n="p13.22"><s n="s1.4;p13.22">Next, let us move on to looking at how Catullus employs the idea of friendship in his poems. </s><s n="s2.4;p13.22">Although Catullus is universally known as a love poet and most of the scholars agree that his main subject is his beloved Lesbia, about three quarters of his first sixty short poems are actually addressed to, or under the subject of, a male or two men, who are almost always called by their name<ref target="BAWE_6076c-ftnote.012"/>. </s><s n="s3.4;p13.22">In a way friendship can be seen as very similar to Love, so that Catullus may be trying to use friendship as a mirror that reflects several features of emotions between a lover and a beloved. </s><s n="s4.4;p13.22">Again, we shall first closely examine an extract from Catullus' collection, the lines 1 to 4 and 15 to 24 of the poem LXV, in which he seems to describe what friendship should be like, and then analyse the reality of friendship which is far more complicated and essentially two-faced. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_6076c-ftnote.012"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Wray, p.70 </s></p></note><quote lang="English"><hi rend="italic">I am exhausted by constant grief, and care calls me away from the Learned Maidens, Hortalus,</hi><hi rend="italic"> nor can my mind produce the sweet offspring of the Muses, for so great are the ills on which it is tossing;</hi> 4 -----------------------------------------------------------------------<hi rend="italic"> And yet, Hortalus, despite such sorrows, I am still sending</hi> 15 <hi rend="italic"> you these songs of Battiades which I have rendered for you: just in case you may think that your words have been entrusted in vain</hi> <hi rend="italic"> to the wondering winds and have poured clean out of my mind;

First of all, friendship can be, just as Love can when both parties involved are faithful and loving to each other, very sweet and tender. </s><s n="s2.4;p18.22">Fro example, in the poem IX, Catullus seems to be so excited about that he will soon see Veranius, a friend of his who is 'more dear than any 300,000 of his many dear friends' and have been away for a while. </s><s n="s3.4;p18.22">The list of welcomes which Catullus said he would give Veranius when he first sees him, such as embracing and kisses, could be seen as almost overreaction for just a friendly greeting, which would probably be more appropriate on the occasion of reunion of a long separated couple. </s><s n="s4.4;p18.22">Similarly in the poem L, Catullus describes himself as if he is in love with his friend Licinius: the excitement of the daytime together prevents him from falling asleep and stirs up his longing for another daytime to converse with each other, and towards the end of the poem his burning passion even leads him to address Licinius 'my beloved'. </s></p><p n="p19.22"><s n="s1.2;p19.22">Friendship could also contain some sort of rivalry, as in the first poem while Catullus express his friend-love towards Nepos by nominating him as an ideal reader of his poems and dedicating the collection to him, simultaneously he implies that his new, neat and polished poem book is as valuable and aesthetic as Nepos' huge, tedious and labouring Italian history books<ref target="BAWE_6076c-ftnote.018"/>. </s><s n="s2.2;p19.22">Or in the poem XIII, Catullus admits that he cannot host a fabulous dinner party like his friend Fabullus because 'his purse is only full of cobwebs', but instead he can provide 'Love's essence' from which Fabullus can sniff a charming and seductive fragrance, which is so attractive that Fabullus would be begging to gods to change him into a big nose. </s></p><note place="foot" id="BAWE_6076c-ftnote.018"><p n="pn1.1"><s n="s1.1;pn1.1">Batstone, p. 126, available online </s></p></note><p n="p20.22"><s n="s1.3;p20.22">At the same time, however, friendship can also result in a complete disaster and full of hatred if it is broken or betrayed, just like Love and marriage do as we have already seen. </s><s n="s2.3;p20.22">The poems LXXIII and LXXVII directly deal with Catullus' friendship which has been spoiled completely, where Catullus explicitly expresses his disappointment and hatred towards whom once he called a true friend. </s><s n="s3.3;p20.22">To some extent, we may be able to argue that Catullus sees friendship as more vulnerable than Love, because whereas Catullus seems to be able to keep loving Lesbia even though she repeatedly shows her unfaithfulness to him and repays his love with betrayal, friendship tends to disappear when one party becomes disloyal to the other and the mutual benefit ceases to exist. </s></p><p n="p21.22"><s n="s1.4;p21.22">The sequence of Gellius, consisting of the poems LXXIV, LXXX, LXXXVIII to XCI and CXIV, is a very interesting material to study in order to find out how friendship can change and be turned over from love to hatred. </s><s n="s2.4;p21.22">It is always difficult to decide in what chronological order each poem was composed because the poems are not arranged from the oldest to the newest in the collection. </s><s n="s3.4;p21.22">Nevertheless, Tatum suggest that we could see one possible storyline by reading these seven poems as (a) Gellius is angry because of the poems LXXIV, LXXX and LXXXVIII to XC which were presumably written by Catullus with a view to 'devastate Gellius' social reputation' through revealing his unnatural and adulterous relation with his aunt, (b) this offence against Gellius is as revenge for his act described in the poem XCI, that is, the stealing of Lesbia, and (c) Catullus is trying to reconcile with Gellius in the poem CXVI through employing the poetic medium as a 'peace offering'<ref target="BAWE_6076c-ftnote.019"/>. </s><s n="s4.4;p21.22">We cannot read from the poem CXVI if or not Catullus' managed to restore his friendship with Gellius with the help of the Muses, but at least friendship is less problematic than Love for Catullus because, due to its breakability, friendship never leads Catullus into a blind alley where he keeps sacrificing himself for his beloved and gaining nothing. </s></p><note place="foot"

complexity and self-contradiction of love relationship by viewing marriage and friendship from all sorts of angles. </s><s n="s2.4;p22.22">Catullus' complicated emotion towards his beloved, which sometimes takes a form of tender love and sometimes of inconsumable anger and hatred, is all magnified into the illustration of these two love relationships which are similarly inclusive of both positive and negative feelings. </s><s n="s3.4;p22.22">This paradoxical picture of love relationship is, however, nothing new to us nearly two thousand years after Catullus' death, and still remains almost identical. </s><s n="s4.4;p22.22">After examining numerous examples of love relationship getting upside down, and falling from happiness to disaster instantly by small chance which seems to be almost completely irrational and beyond our understanding, we seem not yet to find any better observation towards this fact other than Catullus' 'I don't know how.' </s></p></div1></body><back><div1
