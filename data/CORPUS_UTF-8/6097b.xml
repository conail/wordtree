chosen at random the following question: "what does the Solar System look like, and how does it act?", I am sure the answer they would give is: "it has nine planets, all moving around the Sun in separate orbits, each orbit increasing in radius from the Sun", or words to that effect. </s><s rend="italic" n="s2.4;p1.16">It can be suggested (although I have no proof) that every person in the world views the Solar System as a Sun-centred system, otherwise known as a 'heliocentric' system. </s><s rend="italic" n="s3.4;p1.16">However, many hundreds of years ago, a Solar System which put the Earth at its heart (geocentric) was the preferred model. </s><s rend="italic" n="s4.4;p1.16">This paper looks at the history and the relative science between the two models of the system in which we live. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Introduction</head><p n="p2.16"><s n="s1.3;p2.16">The structure of this paper will be such that each model will be explored individually, including the history (ie the origin) of the system, then a critical comparison of the two systems will be made. </s><s n="s2.3;p2.16">Included in the comparison will be pros and cons, for example why the model works, how it is better than the other (if it actually is), what problems were encountered when formulating the models, and how the problems were overcome. </s><s n="s3.3;p2.16">I will start by looking at the geocentric Solar System, as it was the first model to be proposed. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">The Geocentric Solar System (the Ptolemaic System)</head><p n="p3.16"><s n="s1.1;p3.16">Although the first ideas of an ordered universal system came from the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who lived around 384-322 B.C., the first thoroughly developed geocentric model of the Solar System came in about 200 A.D., from Claudius Ptolemy, an Alexandrian Greek. </s></p><p n="p4.16"><s n="s1.13;p4.16">The fundamental idea that the Earth is placed in the centre of the universal system (or the 'cosmos' as it was known in ancient times) came from Aristotle's philosophical views, put forward in his books (titled <hi rend="italic">On the Heavens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Physics)</hi>. </s><s n="s2.13;p4.16">These views forced the cosmos to be regulated by the concept of place, as opposed to space. </s><s n="s3.13;p4.16">In this manner, the cosmos was divided into two specific regions, the earthly region (also known as the sublunary region ie 'below the moon') and the heavens. </s><s n="s4.13;p4.16">The earthly region was a region whereby things lived in a living and dying world, ie things were born, grew and matured while living, then died after a period of time [ref.1]. </s><s n="s5.13;p4.16">This division consisted of substances made up of the four primary elements: earth, water, air and fire, of which, earth and water had a natural tendency to fall towards the centre. </s><s n="s6.13;p4.16">Moreover, because air and fire did not seem to 'gravitate', and fire rose through the air, the complete model of the Earth looked like this: a sphere of earth, surrounded by a sphere of water, a sphere of air and finally a sphere of fire. </s><s n="s7.13;p4.16">It was thought that the sphere of fire was the cause of the charred markings on the Moon [ref.2]. </s><s n="s8.13;p4.16">In contrast to the sublunary region existed the heavens. </s><s n="s9.13;p4.16">This 'place' did not consist of the previous four elements but in fact a fifth element, the quintessence. </s><s n="s10.13;p4.16">This substance was not in any way changeable (ie its properties could not be altered to produce a different element). </s><s n="s11.13;p4.16">The heavenly bodies were defined as being parts of spherical shells which were fixed tightly around each other, and each shell had a specific rotation which determined the motion - a perfectly circular motion - of the heavenly body it encapsulated. </s><s n="s12.13;p4.16">The heavenly bodies were as follows: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and a sphere of fixed stars around the outside (after the fixed stars came the 'prime mover' which accounted for all the motions contained in the cosmos). </s><s n="s13.13;p4.16">It is to be known that the ancient cosmos was finite in extent, beyond the prime mover existed nothing, not even empty space [ref.1]. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_6097b-fig.001"><head>Figure 1 - An Aristotle representation of the cosmos. The elements are spherical shells surrounding the Earth, followed by the heavenly bodies, a sphere of stars and finally the prime mover [ref.3].</head></figure><p n="p5.16"><s n="s1.4;p5.16">Aristotle's views, however, were challenged by astronomy, the most notable being the fact that the heavenly bodies did not move with perfect circular motions. </s><s n="s2.4;p5.16">On the contrary, the motions of the bodies appeared to vary quite substantially. </s><s n="s3.4;p5.16">With regards to the planets, their motions seemed rather peculiar, as a motion where speeding up, slowing down and even reversing was displayed. </s><s n="s4.4;p5.16">This is known as retrograde motion, and is explained below. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_6097b-fig.002"><head> Figure 2 - An example of retrograde motion, where the motion of planet Mars appears to slow down to a stop, reverse to a stop, then speed up again. The planet does not actually behave in this manner, it is simply the effect seen by an observer on the Earth as the planet 'overtakes' Mars in its orbit [ref.4]. </head></figure><p n="p6.16"><s n="s1.4;p6.16">Another major problem with Aristotle's system was that observations showed that the heavenly bodies (Venus, Mars and Jupiter in particular) demonstrated a variation of brightness. </s><s n="s2.4;p6.16">This suggested that the distance between the Earth and the planet varied, and that the planetary sphere was not circular. </s><s n="s3.4;p6.16">Even though Aristotle attempted to overcome this difficulty, his models and calculations always put the Earth at the very centre of the spheres, which meant that the distance between a heavenly body and the Earth never varied. </s><s n="s4.4;p6.16">Since the heavens were deemed perfect, circular and immutable, Aristotle's system could not give an explanation for the varying brightness [ref.1]. </s></p><p n="p7.16"><s n="s1.5;p7.16">Enter Claudius Ptolemy, a second century A.D. Alexandrian Greek. </s><s n="s2.5;p7.16">He put together all the efforts of the people that formed the geocentric model, added his own mathematical creations and constructed a system that successfully explained the observed motions of the surrounding bodies ie the planets. </s><s n="s3.5;p7.16">Ptolemy incorporated small circles called epicycles into his geocentric model that were centred on the large circular orbits [ref.5]. </s><s n="s4.5;p7.16">It was the inclusion of epicycles that made possible the explanation of the observed planetary retrograde motion. </s><s n="s5.5;p7.16">Instead of planets slowing down and reversing their motion, the planets were travelling in an apparently opposite direction on the epicycle. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_6097b-fig.003"><head>Figure 3 - The Ptolemaic Solar System, where a series of epicycles accounts for the planetary retrograde motion [ref.6]. </head></figure></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">The Heliocentric Solar System (the Copernican Model)</head><p n="p8.16"><s n="s1.2;p8.16">Once again, the idea that the Sun was at the centre of the Solar System originated from a Greek philosopher, Aristarchus of Samos (around 300 B.C.) but it really did not have enough support to survive under Aristotle's influence. </s><s n="s2.2;p8.16">In fact, it wasn't until about 1800 years later that the heliocentric model was revived, by a man called Nicholas Copernicus, a Polish astronomer (1473-1543). </s></p><p n="p9.16"><s n="s1.7;p9.16">Copernicus disliked the geocentric system because he found it too complex and for philosophical reasons felt that the relatively tiny Earth should be in motion about the gigantic, radiating Sun. </s><s n="s2.7;p9.16">The Ptolemaic model had versions which contained maybe three or four levels of epicycles [ref.2], and by placing the Sun at the centre, Copernicus realised that some levels of the epicycles could be eliminated. </s><s n="s3.7;p9.16">I say some of the epicycles were removed but not all of them, as Copernicus still retained circular motion in his model and therefore had to construct his system from circles upon and within circles [ref.7]. </s><s n="s4.7;p9.16">The beauty of the Copernican model is that it too accounts for the observed retrograde motion, but in a clearer, more charming way. </s><s n="s5.7;p9.16">The explanation for retrograde motion is simple, such that planets with smaller orbits have a faster motion, and the apparent backwards motion is simply what is observed when a planet with a smaller orbit overtakes' a planet with a larger orbit. </s><s n="s6.7;p9.16">It must be noted however, that although a cleaner conception of the model of the Solar System, the Copernican model did not explain all of the elements of planetary motion without epicycles, it simply replaced some of the epicycles with the orbital motion of the Earth [ref.8]. </s><s n="s7.7;p9.16">It does not predict the positions of the planets with any higher degree of accuracy than the Ptolemaic model therefore it is really no 'better' than the Ptolemaic model, but due to the Occam's Razor principle, the simplest answer is usually deemed the correct answer. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_6097b-fig.004"><head>Figure 4 - A representation of the Copernican model.
