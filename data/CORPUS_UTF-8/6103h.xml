then rapidly cools the material in order to freeze and retain atoms of the alloying elements in the lattice structure of the aluminium. </s><s n="s3.4;p11.24">The rapid cooling process produces a fine structure and because the precipitation is rapid the nucleation rate is high. </s><s n="s4.4;p11.24">The resulting precipitates are small and closely packed together and as such limit the movement of dislocations thus hardening the alloy. </s></p><p n="p12.24"><s n="s1.2;p12.24">The two lines (Graph 2.1) show age hardening for a sample that was left to cool slowly at room temperature after quenching, and one sample which was put into a freezer for the time period after the quench. </s><s n="s2.2;p12.24">These samples were measured for hardness on a daily basis (six days). </s></p><p n="p13.24"><s n="s1.6;p13.24">At temperatures of 520°C for both samples (before quenching), the composition will consist of alpha (single phase) solid solution only. </s><s n="s2.6;p13.24">The quenching process allows the alloy to retain the copper in the solution to produce a 'supersaturated' solution of copper in aluminium. </s><s n="s3.6;p13.24">When the quenched alloy is left at room temperature over a long time period the strength and hardness can be seen to gradually increase as a result of natural age hardening, while ductility is decreased. </s><s n="s4.6;p13.24">Natural age hardening is a slower process of precipitation (the formation of small particles which hinder movement of dislocations) since it occurs at room temperature and a lower rate of cooling. </s><s n="s5.6;p13.24">As a result, increase of hardness over the time period is expected to occur rather slowly. </s><s n="s6.6;p13.24">After a period of around 6 days the hardness tends to average out with

to have constant hardness and suddenly peaks at 96 hours then drops again. </s><s n="s3.5;p14.24">The sudden peak is perhaps attributable to human error in measuring the Brinell Hardness. </s><s n="s4.5;p14.24">The tendency of the freezed sample to exhibit lower hardness can be associated with the freezing process which serves to retard the ageing process that is associated with increasing hardness (?). </s><s n="s5.5;p14.24">It is also known that a new batch of materials was used in the experiment and that some materials are therefore expected to behave more ductile and softer (?).

diffusion, this precipitation hardening increases the amount of 'intermediate coherent' precipitate thus raising the strength and hardness of the alloy. </s></p><p n="p16.24"><s n="s1.1;p16.24">As the
