This means that the safety system must be aligned with the quality system in order both optimal safety and quality outcomes to be achieved (Mol, 2003). </s></p></div2></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold italic">3. Human resources, work environment and technology in an integrated quality and safety management system </head><div2><head rend="bold">3.1. Human resources</head><p n="p6.18"><s n="s1.8;p6.18">An integrated QMS and SMS application in the workplace primarily leads to desirable behavioral change of workers, which in turn generates positive outcomes for both the enterprise and its employees. </s><s n="s2.8;p6.18">The behavioral change provides high level competencies to workers to perform their duties with increased efficiency, safety and quality. </s><s n="s3.8;p6.18">The enterprise has to provide training so that workers develop their ability to evaluate and understand an accident risk and how it is influenced by their behavior. </s><s n="s4.8;p6.18">By QMS aspect, the optimization of human resources is a very important asset that provides a competitive advantage for the enterprise. </s><s n="s5.8;p6.18">By SMS perspective behavioral change is an interesting risk management technique because the traditional approach of a SMS is that employees are the primary source of accident in the workplace. </s><s n="s6.8;p6.18">This traditional safety approach acknowledges that error and unsafe acts arise mostly from behavioral processes such as forgetfulness, inattention, poor motivation, negligence and carelessness. </s><s n="s7.8;p6.18">According to an integrated approach of QMS and SMS systems, human resources need to be maintained at optimal performance so that the probability of an accident to be reduced and the overall performance of the enterprise to be maximized (Dale, <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s8.8;p6.18">1997 and Mol, 2003) </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="bold">3.2 Work environment</head><p n="p7.18"><s n="s1.7;p7.18">A modern SMS approach accepts that the great majority of actual causes of injuries are an interaction between the worker and the facility. </s><s n="s2.7;p7.18">A work environment is a combination of human factors (e.g. competency of workers, overall performance) and physical factors (e.g. heat, hygiene, vibration, noise, humidity, pollution, light, cleanliness and air flow). </s><s n="s3.7;p7.18">Since the scope of a safety system is to moderate these risks, the safety manager has to control and manage both human and physical factors. </s><s n="s4.7;p7.18">If human factors and physical factors are not managed properly, they can result to health and safety risks. </s><s n="s5.7;p7.18">Additionally, the facilitation of employee working environment raises the level of competence and safety consciousness of workers. </s><s n="s6.7;p7.18">Moreover, the physical factors must further be taken into consideration by the grower, because they have the potential to influence motivation and satisfaction of workers, enhancing the performance of the enterprise. </s><s n="s7.7;p7.18">Hence, the control of human and physical factors can be adopted as an integrated common process of SMS and QMS, because it leads to risk management at workplace and improves the overall performance of workers (Mol, 2003 and Tricker, 2001). </s></p><p n="p8.18"><s n="s1.4;p8.18">Noise and vibration is worldwide a major health hazard at workplace. </s><s n="s2.4;p8.18">A packing machine in a tomato nursery can probably lead workers to hearing damage because of the long-term exposure to high levels of noise. </s><s n="s3.4;p8.18">It is important to manage these risks using technologies with lower noise level. </s><s n="s4.4;p8.18">From quality point of view the installation of technology with lower noise level provides better work environment to employees, enhancing their performance, though it can be cost demanding (Mol, 2003). </s></p><p n="p9.18"><s n="s1.12;p9.18">Environmental and air conditions can cause hazards to workers in a tomato nursery. </s><s n="s2.12;p9.18">Solar radiation is an obvious hazard in a tomato nursery and can lead to overheating and sunburn, reducing worker comfort and performance. </s><s n="s3.12;p9.18">High humidity makes working conditions more difficult. </s><s n="s4.12;p9.18">Slippery surfaces due to high moisture or leakage from irrigation systems are possible to occur. </s><s n="s5.12;p9.18">High winds are also hazardous because they can destabilize nursery's structure causing them to collapse. </s><s n="s6.12;p9.18">Hazardous fumes, chemicals and dust are also very common phenomena in a tomato nursery and have undesirable effects on employees' health. </s><s n="s7.12;p9.18">Extreme temperatures in a greenhouse affect worker comfort, safety and the ability to maintain vigilance. </s><s n="s8.12;p9.18">Fatigued employees are not as productive and safe as are alert employees. </s><s n="s9.12;p9.18">Air pollution, heating and humidity in a nursery need to be controlled with the appropriate ventilation system. </s><s n="s10.12;p9.18">Rest breaks and rotation of workers (so that they undertake a variety of tasks, such as lifting, sorting, sitting and standing), can be parts of a safety system. </s><s n="s11.12;p9.18">The safety manager also must be aware of the ability of each person to handle heat stress especially if there are new or temporary workers at workplace. </s><s n="s12.12;p9.18">From quality management point of view, exhaustion of workers due to bad physical conditions in the nursery can lead to low productivity of labor (Mol, 2003). </s></p><p n="p10.18"><s n="s1.6;p10.18">All chemicals present possible hazards and therefore they are under very strict safety regulations. </s><s n="s2.6;p10.18">Agrochemicals can cause irritation symptoms of eyes, nose and throat. </s><s n="s3.6;p10.18">Some workers may also have some particular reactions such as asthma and skin reactions. </s><s n="s4.6;p10.18">Furthermore, workers need to be aware of basic rules of chemical safety when spray or use chemicals. </s><s n="s5.6;p10.18">The manufacturers' labels must be maintained on all chemical containers and in the event a label becomes damaged, removed, or unreadable, the container should be relabeled immediately, so that workers can read them before use (Brown <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s6.6;p10.18">2005) </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="bold">3.3 Technology</head><p n="p11.18"><s n="s1.8;p11.18">Technology has a lead-time before it begins to degrade and before this deterioration causes an unacceptable hazard. </s><s n="s2.8;p11.18">For instance, handling equipment, cladding materials, vehicles (small tractors), packing equipment, sorting equipment are necessary technology in a tomato nursery. </s><s n="s3.8;p11.18">However, as technology degrades the probability of an incident rises. </s><s n="s4.8;p11.18">Safety management identifies hazards and risks of suboptimal old equipment in order to prevent the probability of an accident. </s><s n="s5.8;p11.18">A QMS has to take a cost-benefit decision of operating old equipment. </s><s n="s6.8;p11.18">Assuming that the technology remains operational though it is less efficient, it may be more effective to continue to operate the old technology than replacing it with new one. </s><s n="s7.8;p11.18">This is conflict point between QMS and SMS. Nevertheless, a QMS has to consider that there are hidden costs when old equipment is used. </s><s n="s8.8;p11.18">For instance, suboptimal equipment results to suboptimal productivity, costly maintenance, damage to technology (e.g. withdrawal from service for unplanned maintenance to rectify its deteriorated condition), higher labor demands, less safety (expenses from injury to an employee) and losses of productive hours (Mol, 2003). </s></p><p n="p12.18"><s n="s1.3;p12.18">New technology is safer than old technology, provided that employees are familiar with the technological change. </s><s n="s2.3;p12.18">Pre-operational training and practice to new equipment are basic demands of a joint quality and safety management system. </s><s n="s3.3;p12.18">Risk assessment continues until the employees become skilled with the new equipment as they were with the old equipment (Mol, 2003). </s></p></div2></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold italic">4.
