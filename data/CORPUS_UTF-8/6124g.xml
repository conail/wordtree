processes for the transition to farming are described in the several models, one of the most simplified versions is wave of advance model by Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza (Zvelebil 1986: 5-16). </s><s n="s2.5;p3.20">This model has been applied quantitative methods from radiocarbon data, which led to produce regression analysis of the spread rate of agricultural diffusion from assumed origin in Jericho to approximately 1km per year on average (Gkiastaal. 2003:45). </s><s n="s3.5;p3.20">The estimation of the agricultural arrival in different parts of Europe is indicated by figure 1 (Ammerman

length (Zvelebil 1986: 5-16). </s></p><p n="p4.20"><s n="s1.7;p4.20">According to these transition theories and models, the Neolithic innovations, in especially agricultural practice, appear in the archaeological records throughout Britain within a few hundred years, therefore the dietary shift at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition has been also considered as the gradual, 'piecemeal' adoption (Richards 2003: 31-36). </s><s n="s2.7;p4.20">These gradual dietary shift and cultural continuity is frequently supported by the archaeological records from Danish Mesolithic and Neolithic period, where has one of the richest artefactual evidence in coastal Western Europe (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s><s n="s3.7;p4.20">Ertebølle culture has been lasted approximately 5400 and 3900 cal BC in

the evidence of cereal cultivation as well as animal husbandry (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s><s n="s5.7;p4.20">Ertebølle culture is known as an abundant fishing, shell-gathering and sea-mammals hunting along coastal sites, with elaborate archaeological fishing tool evidences (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s><s n="s6.7;p4.20">The evidences of sea mammals hunting are identified in table 1 (Milneral. 2004: 9-22). </s><s n="s7.7;p4.20">More recently, underwater excavations have revealed the spectacular condition of organic evidences, such as wooden fish traps, fish spears and boats, from

n="s2.3;p5.20">The study of shell midden has contributed to interpret subsistence changes in Mesolithic Neolithic transition, and demonstrate the importance of marine resources as a substantial contribution to Mesolithic diets (Thomas 2003: 67-73). </s><s n="s3.3;p5.20">In Britain and Denmark, the occupation continuity is identified with the evidence of typical Neolithic ceramic and remains of domesticated animals above the Late Mesolithic contexts of shell middens (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s></p><p n="p6.20"><s n="s1.2;p6.20">However, it is frequently argued that the coastal sites were possibly the task-specific camps, and main settlements could be located inland. </s><s n="s2.2;p6.20">This perspective has suggested the collecting foods, and removing for consumption at other settlement sites, and this is reinforced by recent excavations, for example, bulky foods have been butchered and discarded to ease of transport at the coastal camps for transport to interior sites (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s></p><p n="p7.20"><s n="s1.7;p7.20">According to the combination of archaeological evidences and agricultural transition models, the gradual shift at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition and cultural continuity were expected. </s><s n="s2.7;p7.20">However, the study of the proportion of stable isotope from Mesolithic and Neolithic human skeletons do not support the idea of a slow, gradual and 'piecemeal' adoption, but indicate a rapid and dramatic change from marine to terrestrial based diets (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s><s n="s3.7;p7.20">Thus, this section is going to provide the over view of stable isotope analysis, moreover represents data interpretation of stable isotope studies of dietary shift. </s><s n="s4.7;p7.20">Both of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis have largely contributed to the understandings of human diets in Mesolithic and Neolithic periods from protein portion of human skeletons. </s><s n="s5.7;p7.20">Generally, the δ¹³C value indicates whether the main dietary protein from marine or terrestrial sources, whereas the δ¹⁵N value indicates the trophic level of the protein consumed collagen (Richardsal. 2003: 288-293). </s><s

δ¹³C values is a quantitative measurement of the amounts of two types of protein that have been consumed, for example δ¹³C values of -16‰ suggest a diet with approximately half terrestrial and half marine protein (Richards and Hedges 1999:891-897). </s></p><table id="BAWE_6124g-tab.002"><head>Table 2: indicates the basic estimated δ¹³ C values for identifying whether diet is based on terrestrial

(2004:9-22) suggest that an oversimplification of isotopic data from widely distributed skeletal remains from Mesolithic and Neolithic sites. </s><s n="s3.4;p16.20">The composition of human bone collagen has been reflected by the protein portion of the diet (Milneral. 2004:9-22), therefore do not reflect the total diet of an individual, this problem is explained as 'Preliminary models" which show that a diet dominated by plant-food might includes up to 20 per cent of marine protein without raising theδ¹³C values of bone collagen above 21‰, this would standardly be interpreted as a diet dominated by terrestrial food (Barbereba and Borrero 2004:191-195), therefore certainly do not demonstrate the complete abandonment of marine resources (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s><s n="s4.4;p16.20">Moreover, Thomas (2003: 67-73) has explained the dietary shift from marine to terrestrial foods does not always show the shift from hunter-gatherer to agriculture society at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition, because stable isotope analysis can not distinguish between wild and domesticated resources, therefore Rowley-Conwy (2004: 91) have argued the Neolithic terrestrial foods might be as wild rather than domestic, and the Neolithic population is not easily sustained without a predominantly agricultural economy (Rowley-Conwy 2004: 91). </s></p><p n="p17.20"><s n="s1.3;p17.20">Furthermore, the reason why several archaeological evidences have supported the cultural continuity is that there are the significant interpretational differences between the isotope data and the artefactual evidences. </s><s n="s2.3;p17.20">These differences are often derived from representing different phenomena, for example isotope data often refers to the dominant protein intake by an individual during the last 10 years before death, whereas the faunal assemblages often refer to the generalised dietary tendency in specific environment over long period (Barbereba and Borrero 2004:191-195). </s><s n="s3.3;p17.20">Thus, it is not preferred to completely rely on the stable isotope results for interpretation of dietary shift at Mesolithic Neolithic transition. </s></p><p n="p18.20"><s n="s1.6;p18.20">Furthermore, the change in subsistence economy has might been derived from the environmental factors, it is discussed by Milner (2002:89-95), a Litorina Sea regression might have contributed to the dramatic reduction in the numbers of oysters, and led to a shift in subsistence practices to a farming economy, although it is hard to know the level of influence pressure on the oyster in Mesolithic and Neolithic period. </s><s n="s2.6;p18.20">However, Milner (2002:89-95) have concluded that the combination of these environmental factors and other social economic transformations might be the result of these subsistence shift at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. </s><s n="s3.6;p18.20">Moreover, the sample size bias is came from less available British Mesolithic samples, due to the submerged shoreline, therefore only seven individuals are dated to Mesolithic and 67 individuals are dated to Neolithic, although the minimum numbers of individuals are hard to assess (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s><s n="s4.6;p18.20">Milner et al.(2004:9-22) have been studied the estimation of total population size for Mesolithic Britain, with assuming a population density of 0.1 individuals per ㎢, and one million of simplicity of estimated population, and seven identified individuals in Late Mesolithic Britain, therefore representing 0.000007 per cent of the total population with stable isotope analysis. </s><s n="s5.6;p18.20">This estimated population densities are giving some idea of Mesolithic and Neolithic period, although there should have been population fractionation. </s><s n="s6.6;p18.20">Thus, the limited sample size urges caution in interpretation (Milneral. 2004:9-22). </s></p><p n="p19.20"><s n="s1.5;p19.20">As discussed above, the complete shift in main diets at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition are largely supported by stable isotope results from human skeletal remains. </s><s n="s2.5;p19.20">However, Preliminary

or adopted by indigenous people, this essay largely suggests the dietary shift is considered as rather gradual than rapid and abrupt transition, which is supported by the limitations of stable isotope measurements, sample bias, transition theories, as well as abundant archaeological remains, which tend to support the cultural continuity at Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. </s><s
