analysis has been recognised as an important step to provide reliable information as help on decision making for stakeholders involved. </s><s n="s2.4;p1.37">Land use suitability analysis is defined as to identify the most appropriate spatial pattern for potential land uses based on the investigation on the requirements of land features for a specific purpose, on preferences and on the predicted activities and their impacts on land (Makczewski, 2004). </s><s n="s3.4;p1.37">For instance, the targets include identification of potential habitat for wildlife, analysis on agricultural land use, and regional development planning. </s><s n="s4.4;p1.37">It is often aimed at proposing the best site for the specific purposes by ranking and rating the known characteristics of alternative candidate sites, such as location, size, climate, geological features, and proximity to important sites (Makczewski, 2004, Phua and Minowa, 2005). </s></p><p n="p2.37"><s n="s1.8;p2.37">Geographical Information System (GIS) has been widely used as a tool for such analysis in land use planning. </s><s n="s2.8;p2.37">One example is forest management or conservation planning. </s><s n="s3.8;p2.37">Important function of GIS in forest planning is the ability to integrate various information in maps as associated databases, providing an answer which meets a set of criteria on planning in spatial context (Zek and Keles, 2005). </s><s n="s4.8;p2.37">The primary use of GIS was in forestry with aims to store maps in electric forms and to perform calculations such as areas, distances. </s><s n="s5.8;p2.37">It is now increasing applied for analysis to solve complex problems, for example, selection of sites for conservation, evaluation of alternative land uses (Makczewski, 2004, Zek and Keles, 2005). </s><s n="s6.8;p2.37">Spatial database in GIS may contain ownership boundaries, locations of roads, water courses, elevation, soil maps, and climatic features which enables practitioners to examine what activities to be carried out in which spatial scales. </s><s n="s7.8;p2.37">GIS also provides an aid to visualise landscape pattern of a forest, such as shape, size, distribution of patches or management units, spatial relationships between different land characteristics such as urban areas, agricultural land. </s><s n="s8.8;p2.37">Such spatial structure and features of forest determine biodiversity, aesthetic values, and susceptibility to disturbances (Zek and Keles, 2005, Phua and Minowa, 2005). </s></p><p n="p3.37"><s n="s1.2;p3.37">The aim of this report is to illustrate the use of GIS in forest planning. </s><s n="s2.2;p3.37">In particular, objectives are to find the potential site for creating buffer zones from motor ways for neighbouring communities around the existing community forest Watling Chase in London, U.K and to investigate criteria for further evaluation on planning. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold italic">Study site</head><p n="p4.37"><s n="s1.5;p4.37">Watling Chase Community Forest is in south Hertfordshire and north London which consists of 188 km area of a mixture of farmland, meadows, wildlife areas, hedgerows and woodland as well as public open space and the urban fringe (Fig. </s><s n="s2.5;p4.37">1). </s><s n="s3.5;p4.37">This forest is one of 12 Community Forests in England established in 1990 by the then-Countryside Commission as pilot project areas to demonstrate the potential contribution of forests to economic and to social regeneration (England's community forests, 2007, Watling Chae Community Forest, 2007). </s><s n="s4.5;p4.37">According to the Review 2005, the suggested key sites of interest in Watling Chase for the future management are new plantation along motor way corridors in order to reduce the impact of traffic fumes on air quality (Vaughan, 2005). </s><s n="s5.5;p4.37">Therefore, evaluation of areas for the potential buffer zone is an important process to be carried out for this target and for deliberation of the actual plans. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_6131u-fig.001"><head>Fig 1.

would be beneficial for such possibility. </s><s n="s6.6;p23.37">Hence, further investigation on the ecological features of woodland and of neighbouring land should be prioritised. </s></p><p n="p24.37"><s n="s1.4;p24.37">Much of the identified areas were under agricultural uses or grassland where the conversion to forests should not be proposed due to land ownership issues and economic issues of local communities (Fig 5 and 7). </s><s n="s2.4;p24.37">On the other hand, creation of buffer zones from the motorway traffic seemed an important issue for local communities, thus the conversion of agricultural land into woodland buffer zones should be evaluated its significance. </s><s n="s3.4;p24.37">The narrow buffer zone, possibly less than 0.5 km in width, may be feasible option. </s><s n="s4.4;p24.37">Investigation, consultation and decision-making should focus on the minimum requirement of woodland for buffer and for ecological function as well as on the other socio-economic issues on land use changes. </s></p><p n="p25.37"><s n="s1.4;p25.37">Although 1.0 km width of buffer zone was identified as the 'maximum buffer zone', it was suggested that new plantation or extension of forests to this large spatial scale would be unlikely to be appraised due to many factors (Fig 4 and 5). </s><s n="s2.4;p25.37">Various land uses at present, the extent of potential impacts induced by conversion of land to woodland, changes in landscape pattern would also likely to be considerable. </s><s n="s3.4;p25.37">Management problems associated with such large scale forest would be an important issue in the long-term. </s><s n="s4.4;p25.37">Nevertheless, the presentation of this buffer zone on maps would be useful as an indicator on the scale of forest planning, particularly for considering the expansion of community forest to important conservation site in the future. </s></p></div2></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold italic">Discussion

n="s2.7;p26.37">Representation of social, economic features in the environment as well as geographical elements is the first priority consideration (Makczewski, 2004, Phua and Minowa, 2005). </s><s n="s3.7;p26.37">Moreover, the process to combine objective and subjective information such as judgments and preferences is vital in order to reflect every view and feature which contributes to decision making on the target land. </s><s n="s4.7;p26.37">Demonstration of information in the form of maps by GIS approach has a risk that it may be misleading by over-influencing the value system of map developer (Makczewski, 2004). </s><s n="s5.7;p26.37">In this case of forest planning, conversion of land to woodland as buffer zone involves evaluation of socio-economic gain and losses by potential activities. </s><s n="s6.7;p26.37">Decision in such case would be complex, and should be made in conjunction with consultation with local people, land owners and uses. </s><s n="s7.7;p26.37">In order to achieve satisfactory agreement on land planning, information provided on the produced maps is very important and maps should contain all the required data sets for evaluation. </s></p><div2><head rend="bold">Potential </head><p n="p27.37"><s n="s1.4;p27.37">Although the level of analysis carried out was simple, potential of the produced maps in terms of

objectives. </s><s n="s3.4;p27.37">The maps have effectively selected the most appropriate areas and issues of interest for initiating the evaluation process and have shown the areas for prioritisation. </s><s n="s4.4;p27.37">Comparison of two maps; woodland and agricultural land would be useful to find out geographical relationship between those areas under different land cover, indicating the feasibility and difficulty in creating the buffer zones at a particular area. </s></p></div2><div2><head rend="bold">Limitation</head><p n="p28.37"><s n="s1.1;p28.37">There are several

and buffer zones, and recognition on the importance of the buffer zones should be taken account in the real world situation. </s><s n="s2.3;p34.37">As mentioned, the significance of GIS approach is to enable map makers to integrate various information on factors affecting and/or likely to affect land uses in the form of maps (Makczewski, 2004, Zek and Keles, 2005). </s><s n="s3.3;p34.37">Data

n="s2.2;p35.37">Other environmental factors </s></p><p n="p36.37"><s n="s1.3;p36.37">Elevation, climatic conditions were assumed to have little constraints in the area of interest based on the fact that there are woodland patches in broader spatial scale around the existing forest of the selected region, indicating that much of surrounding land is likely to be relatively homogeneous in relation to the potential of land properties for forest growth. </s><s n="s2.3;p36.37">However, topography would be an important attribute since visual landscape is greatly affected by changes in elevation and on the distribution of forest cover (Phua and Minowa, 2005, Zek and Keles, 2005). </s><s n="s3.3;p36.37">Such factor may be considered to contribute to aesthetic value for which the role of community forest should be targeted. </s></p><p n="p37.37"><s n="s1.6;p37.37">In conclusion, in spite of the limited amount of datasets used to give solution to the objectives; to identify the potential sites for extension of forests along the motor way in the close proximity to the existing community forest, the result provides a comprehensive map to visualise the key sites of interest in planning. </s><s n="s2.6;p37.37">It has been identified that current land cover and land uses; woodland or grassland and agricultural land would be the key elements for further evaluation. </s><s n="s3.6;p37.37">Evaluation criteria may include the vicinity of the existing forests or woodlands in order to enhance the wildlife value by extending the existing habitat, the importance of current land uses to local communities, or preferences of local residence on the structure, size of buffer zones. </s><s n="s4.6;p37.37">There is much potential on the produced maps to be applied for similar problems. </s><s n="s5.6;p37.37">In relation to the quality of visualisation of information required, this outcome has successfully represented the specific site on which the target on management planning and further evaluation should be based. </s><s n="s6.6;p37.37">This report has demonstrated the potential and limitation of GIS approach for the specific problem associated with land use
