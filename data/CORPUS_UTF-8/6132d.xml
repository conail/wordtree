Merkle entitled "Nanotechnology: It's a Small, Small, Small, Small World" describes how nanotechnology will enable logic elements to be constructed from just a few atoms, memory storage devices that could hold more than a hundred billion billion bytes will take only the volume of a sugar cube. </s></p><p n="p3.29"><s n="s1.4;p3.29">Nanoscale engineering involves two different processes one, the traditional method of forming shapes called "top-down" and the new known as "bottom-up". </s><s n="s2.4;p3.29">Top-down involves taking your raw material and cutting it down to the size and shape you desire, bottom-up involves taking each atom one by one and placing them together until you achieve the required structure. </s><s n="s3.4;p3.29">Bottom-up is a complicated process but it can be made easier as some materials such as nanowires can self assemble, the structures are simple and the atoms (carbon) naturally combine in these specific forms due to bonding preferences. </s><s n="s4.4;p3.29">In our cells DNA is reproduced to make new with the aid of proteins, it is hoped that similarly nanomachines may be developed that either self replicate or replicate other existing nanostructures to replace the old. </s></p><p n="p4.29"><s n="s1.8;p4.29">However, there are some negative aspects to this technology, this is a new science and the past has demonstrated how science can lead in unpredictable and often undesirable directions. </s><s n="s2.8;p4.29">Little is known about the toxicological effects of nanoparticles or the effects of these on the natural world, they might react unfavourably with the nanoprocesses already present. </s><s n="s3.8;p4.29">It is well known that size especially at the nanoscale effects the physical and chemical properties of a material, for example gold used in glass making will colour the glass blue, red or gold depending on its fineness. </s><s n="s4.8;p4.29">Nanomachines would be incredibly tiny often undetectable to the human eye. </s><s n="s5.8;p4.29">The largest and most complicated would perhaps be the size of the period at the end of this sentence. </s><s n="s6.8;p4.29">Further ideas of nanobots consist of many tiny ones working in a team with swarm intelligence. </s><s n="s7.8;p4.29">If they can be programmed for positive use then they could also be programmed for negative, even without the danger of human influence machines can still go wrong, what if we lost control? </s><s n="s8.8;p4.29">One famous theoretical nightmare scenario is that proposed by K Eric Drexler in his book Engines of Creation, here he describes the world being eaten up by self replicating nanobots until all that is left is a sort of grey-goo. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined">Nanotechnology

of ski waxes and the era of synthetics has accelerated this process. </s><s n="s3.6;p8.29">However, the birth of nanotechnology has outpaced past developments with a new type of wax containing nanoparticles. </s><s n="s4.6;p8.29">Developed by Nanogate and marketed under the label Cerax Naowax it provides a long lasting, hard surface which remains free from build up. </s><s n="s5.6;p8.29">It consists of both adhesive and non-adhesive particles combined with binding nanoparticles dissolved in a solvent. </s><s n="s6.6;p8.29">When applied the particles organise themselves as the solvent evaporates, the adhesive particles gravitate to the surface of the ski and the non-adhesive particles to the outside, the nanoparticles bind the two layers together and this results in a thin protective film that is both hydrophobic and oleophobic. </s></p><p n="p9.29"><s n="s1.6;p9.29">Nanotechnology has vast implications for the food industry; it is proposed that food products could be

be based in one country or region will not be so effective for the communication of nanotechnology. </s><s n="s3.10;p12.29">The newspaper industry is a business, the companies need to sell papers and therefore only print stories that are newsworthy, that will sell because they are of public interest. </s><s n="s4.10;p12.29">Consequentially one expects much hype and exaggeration of the issues
