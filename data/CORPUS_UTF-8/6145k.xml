therefore the cross breeding helps to keep the sheep size relatively small. </s><s n="s2.5;p9.22">This therefore allows for a higher stocking density. </s><s n="s3.5;p9.22">The farm soil is relatively thin and not ideally suited to organic production. </s><s n="s4.5;p9.22">However, this breed of sheep is suited to the thin soil and also due to the nature of the breed they are better adapted to looking after themselves. </s><s n="s5.5;p9.22">Crossing Shetlands with Poll Dorsets is a good combination because Poll Dorset 'ewes are of medium size and are naturally prolific <hi

farm is currently phasing out the Hampshire Down Sires, as this breed is not ideally suited to the soil type at the farm. </s><s n="s3.3;p10.22">The Texels are a good breed for long keeping lambs, and so this breed is often used in the later lambing flock. </s></p><p n="p11.22"><s n="s1.3;p11.22">Sheepdorve uses a variety of different breeds of sheep because different breeds finish at different periods throughout the year. </s><s n="s2.3;p11.22">Sheepdrove therefore use a variety of sires so that the lambs are finishing at different periods. </s><s n="s3.3;p11.22">This is therefore an important aspect for Sheepdrove, as it is aiming to finish lambs throughout the year and needs to be able to kill 50 lambs per week. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined

for the ewes to adjust to the housing and the feeding techniques in the housing system. </s><s n="s3.5;p12.22">The early housing means that the ewes are not getting stressed closer to the pregnancy which is when the ewes need the highest energy intake. </s><s n="s4.5;p12.22">Housing later in the pregnancy can often lead to pregnancy toxaemia. </s><s n="s5.5;p12.22">Sheepdrove only house the early lambing flock because of the disease risk associated with the system and it is usually the older stocks that come inside. </s></p><p n="p13.22"><s n="s1.8;p13.22">The indoor flock is feed for 1 month before being housed. </s><s n="s2.8;p13.22">The ewes are feed oats, and by feeding a month before housing, allows the ewes to get used to the oats. </s><s n="s3.8;p13.22">Last year Sheepdrove feed a mixture of beans and barley, but this feed was making the lambs too big and therefore the ewes encountered greater problems during birth. </s><s n="s4.8;p13.22">Later on in the pregnancy the ewes require high protein content in feed and also during the early lactation period. </s><s n="s5.8;p13.22">This is because 'the requirements of the ewes and lambs are high' <hi rend="italic">(Croston, D Pollott, G 1985 pg 127)</hi> during this period. </s><s n="s6.8;p13.22">The ewes are also feed grass silage as a bulk feed. </s><s n="s7.8;p13.22">Grass silage should be 'wilted to a dry matter of 25-28%' <hi rend="italic">(Croston, D Pollott, G 1985 pg 127).</hi> </s><s n="s8.8;p13.22">This is because the intake by the ewes will be reduced if the silage is high in acid and wet. </s></p><p n="p14.22"><s n="s1.9;p14.22">The condition of the ewe during mating and throughout the pregnancy is an important aspect in relation to the feeding of the ewe. </s><s

ideal, however it is acceptable for ewes to lose about 3% of live weight or 0.25 of a condition score <hi rend="italic">(Boden, E ed 1991 pg 32).</hi> </s><s n="s4.9;p14.22">In the middle stages of the pregnancy the important aspect is the growth of the placenta which is complete at 90days <hi rend="italic">(Boden, E ed 1991 pg 32).</hi> </s><s n="s5.9;p14.22">It is important that during this stage of pregnancy ewes are not too fat and also ewes with a very high body condition score may benefit from a drop in condition score as it can lead to reductions in the lambs birth weight. </s><s n="s6.9;p14.22">The last 6 to 8 weeks of pregnancy are vitally important for both ewe and lamb. </s><s n="s7.9;p14.22">During this period the lamb gains about 70% of its birth weight <hi rend="italic">(Boden, E ed 1991 pg 33).</hi> </s><s n="s8.9;p14.22">This demonstrates why the nutrition of the ewe is of great importance during this period. </s><s n="s9.9;p14.22">It also suggests why Sheepdrove start feeding slightly before this period to ensure that the ewes are used to the feeding system and therefore do not jeopardise the birth weight of the lambs. </s></p><p n="p15.22"><s

n="s2.4;p16.22">This indicates that the use of indoor housing systems to help to control the feed management in ewes and therefore contributes to the nutrients in lactation. </s><s n="s3.4;p16.22">At Sheepdrove the lambs are finished on a mixture of grass, turnips and oats. </s><s n="s4.4;p16.22">They are also feed a good silage mix. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined

practices are in place to prevent the spread of animal diseases <hi rend="italic">(Defra 2005).</hi> </s><s n="s2.4;p17.22">This is particularly important in organic farming systems because of the reduced artificial inputs that the farm is able to use. </s><s n="s3.4;p17.22">Sheepdrove farm has no scrapies in the sheep flocks which will partly be due to Biosecurity. </s><s n="s4.4;p17.22">Also, the farm has a closed flock which means that no new replacements are brought into the flock which helps to maintain a healthy flock. </s></p><p n="p18.22"><s n="s1.2;p18.22">Biosecurity is important to prevent the spread of diseases such as foot and mouth disease, but it is also important to control the spread of diseases such as ecoli and foot problems. </s><s n="s2.2;p18.22">Sheepdrove do still experience problems such as ecoli in the indoor housed ewes and also foot rot is a big problem for the farm. </s></p><p n="p19.22"><s n="s1.3;p19.22">Sheepdrove has to produce a farm health plan that is approved by a certified body such as the Soil Association. </s><s n="s2.3;p19.22">As Sheepdrove is an organic farm it requires permission to use certain products. </s><s n="s3.3;p19.22">This health plan is linked to the issue of Biosecurity because it helps the farm to outline any possible issues and problems and to achieve suitable outcomes. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined bold">Conclusion</head><p n="p20.22"><s n="s1.3;p20.22">Sheepdrove has to carefully consider the sheep production system used due to the organic status of the farm. </s><s n="s2.3;p20.22">The farm is careful to lamb the majority of its ewes outside to avoid the disease and health problems associated with indoor housed lambing. </s><s n="s3.3;p20.22">The farm needs to continue with the indoor housing however, in order to be able to produce lamb for year round sale through the farm shops and box scheme. </s></p><p n="p21.22"><s n="s1.6;p21.22">The breed's chosen for the producing are an important aspect in the year round production because different breeds finish at different live weights and also at different periods throughout the year. </s><s n="s2.6;p21.22">This is a very important aspect for Sheepdrove farm because of the way they market their lamb. </s><s n="s3.6;p21.22">The feeding of the ewes during pregnancy is also an important element for Sheepdrove. </s><s n="s4.6;p21.22">The ewes need to be feed appropriately at each stage of pregnancy to avoid any problems during the pregnancy and birth. </s><s n="s5.6;p21.22">The correct feeding of ewes will also help to produce healthy lambs. </s><s n="s6.6;p21.22">This aspect is particularly important in organic systems because the use of antibiotics is only allowed at the discretion of the certifying body and this is usually only in extreme circumstances. </s></p><p n="p22.22"><s n="s1.2;p22.22">Sheepdrove farm seem to use appropriate breeds and management practices to allow for the year round supply of lamb. </s><s n="s2.2;p22.22">The marketing strategies used by the farm are an important tool in aiding the sale of otherwise unusual meat, such as the mutton and young ram meat. </s></p></div1></body><back><div1 type="bibliography"><head rend="underlined bold">References</head><div2 type="bibliography"><head rend="underlined bold">Books</head><p>Boden, E (ed)
