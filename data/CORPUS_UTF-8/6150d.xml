on Sampling' cited on page 39 of the handbook 'Statistical Aspects of Q.A', the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) for a given sampling plan is the rate of non-conforming items at which a lot will be rejected with a low probability, usually 5%. </s><s n="s2.8;p24.26">It is also referred to as particular producers' risk. </s><s n="s3.8;p24.26">Additionally, AQL can be used as an indexing criterion applied to a continuous series of lots which corresponds to a maximum rate of acceptable defective items in lots (or the maximum number of defective items per hundred items). </s><s n="s4.8;p24.26">The very important aspect of AQL is that it is a quality goal fixed by the profession. </s><s n="s5.8;p24.26">What that means is higher the rate of defective items exceeds the AQL, the greater is the probability of rejection of a lot. </s><s n="s6.8;p24.26">Therefore, for any given sample size, if the AQL is lowered, then the protection for the consumer against accepting lots with high defective rates becomes greater, and the requirement for the producer to conform with sufficiently high quality requirements becomes greater as well. </s><s n="s7.8;p24.26">However, any value for

(i.e. </s><s n="s3.9;p25.26">0.1% to 0.65%); whereas the second category is the compositional characteristics such as fat or water content, etc, and this may be associated with a higher AQL (e.g.

n="s1.2;p26.26">Based on the principles discussed above, referring to my sampling scheme in this exercise, as estimated in Q(c) the corresponding AQLs of the producers' risk for the 3 single sampling plans of normal inspection, tightened inspection and reduced inspection are 0.75%, 0.35% and 0.75% respectively. </s><s n="s2.2;p26.26">As all the AQLs are close enough to 0.65%, which are considered to be low AQL values, the sampling scheme here containing the three single sampling plans can be allocated to the particular food situations (problems), which are class A nonconformities that are characteristics of food linking to critical defects, (e.g. sanitary risks like pesticide content in follow-up milk and other safety respects of the products).
