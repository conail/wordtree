the chickens are killed on a Thursday, hung over the weekend and are then ready for the shop for Wednesday. </s><s n="s6.6;p5.10">This is because the biggest demand for chicken is on Wednesday through to Saturday. </s></p><p n="p6.10"><s n="s1.4;p6.10">The farm also has a flock of 800 ewes, 100 of these are poll Dorset ewes, the rest are North Country Mules which are served by Hampshire or Texsel rams. </s><s n="s2.4;p6.10">The sheep enterprise is also set up to meet the demands of the shop. </s><s n="s3.4;p6.10">As the shop wishes to supply lamb all year round the farm has four lambing periods at Christmas, late February, April, and May. </s><s n="s4.4;p6.10">This ensures that there are lambs available all year round so the farm is able to supply its customers with the goods they want. </s></p><p n="p7.10"><s n="s1.6;p7.10">The farm also has a herd of large black pigs which consists of 6 sows and 2 boars, each sow has 20 piglets a year in 2 litters they are weaned at 6 weeks, and are kept outside in grassed paddocks and fed on cereal based roll as well as foraging for themselves. </s><s n="s2.6;p7.10">They are slaughtered at 9 months; the pork is then used to make bacon, sausages and ham that are being sold through the farm shop. </s><s n="s3.6;p7.10">The pigs are proving to be a viable enterprise, while also helping to maintain the numbers of the breed which is listed as critical on the rare breed trust website. </s><s n="s4.6;p7.10">The breed was first introduced to the farm because there was a shop already in place to sell the meat, and also because it gives the shop an edge over its competition. </s><s n="s5.6;p7.10">The shop is able to advertise the fact that it has a rare breed of meat for sale that is not widely available, and hopefully then draw in more business. </s><s n="s6.6;p7.10">If there was not already a shop to sell it through or if the farm had no competition then the pigs probably wouldn't be kept. </s></p><p n="p8.10"><s n="s1.5;p8.10">The farm shop is on the site of an old contractor business, which used to sell frozen beef as a side enterprise from a small shop. </s><s n="s2.5;p8.10">The shop now sells beef, lamb, free range chicken and pork all from the farm as well as other local produce such as pickles, cheeses and juices. </s><s n="s3.5;p8.10">In 2004 the shop was awarded Hampshire Meat Producer/Retailer of the Year; this has helped to draw customers to the shop. </s><s n="s4.5;p8.10">Manydown estate took over the shop in 1994 when it was making £50,000 per annum, the shop has since grown and has had three extensions and now makes £780,000 per annum with most weeks seeing 700 customers a week. </s><s n="s5.5;p8.10">Over the last 10 years the shop has managed to achieve growth of 10% per year, with word of mouth being the main advertiser, but the shop now needs to look at other ways to advertise itself to more people so it can continue growing. </s></p><p n="p9.10"><s n="s1.3;p9.10">The reason the farm shop was first created was because the farm could no longer make as much money due to the increased supply and very small increase in demand which came about after the UK joined the EU, subsidies were used to help farmers but they were reduced in the 1990s and this meant farmers either had to diversify, expand, downsize or quit. </s><s n="s2.3;p9.10">Manydown decided that it would diversify, there were many options open to them such as use the land for forestry or leisure, rent out buildings for leisure or work, go into the agricultural inputs sector, or go in to the process and retail sector. </s><s n="s3.3;p9.10">They choose the retail sector and hence why there is now a farm shop. </s></p><p n="p10.10"><s n="s1.3;p10.10">The shop and the farm have a close relationship that has meant that the farm can supply the shop with exactly what it needs, meaning that its customers are delivered with exact the products they want all year round in most cases. </s><s n="s2.3;p10.10">The shop is able to adapt quickly to customer demands as the shop has a direct link to its suppliers and can work with them to get exactly the products they want and often at short notice. </s><s n="s3.3;p10.10">This has meant that the shop has seen a growth in its customer numbers. </s></p></div1></body><back/></text></TEI.2>
