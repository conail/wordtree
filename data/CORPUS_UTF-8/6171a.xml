adults through the use of deforming apparatus, such as bands and cradle-boards, artificially modified the cranial vaults of their children or those in their care (Blackwood &amp; Danby 1955: 173). </s><s n="s2.7;p2.41">Possible examples of this practice have now been identified to Shanidar Cave in Iraq, around 45,000 years BP (Trinkaus 1982 &amp;

Mann 1978: 161). </s><s n="s4.7;p2.41">The purpose in this case was apparently one of status identification as Hippocrates recognised the longest heads were those of the most noble individuals (ibid); a similar stimulus could be found in upper-class Chinese women who would have their feet bound to restrict the growth both by length and width (Ortner &amp; Putschar 1981). </s><s n="s5.7;p2.41">Other influence for the adoption of this practice may possibly include as an ethnic marker (Özbek 2001) or religious observance (Hrdlička 1919). </s><s n="s6.7;p2.41">In other cultures, the modified skull has become one of aesthetic pleasure (Blackwood &amp; Danby 1955; Ortner &amp; Putschar 1981; Trinkaus 1983); there is record of the disappointment of a woman with mild deformity in New Britain, Papua New Guinea, that her mother had not pulled the bandage tighter, therefore increasing the modification (Blackwood &amp; Danby 1955: 175). </s><s n="s7.7;p2.41">When observed by an outsider, the affect is often displeasing and results in descriptions such as "a very ugly deformation of the head" (de la Vega 1966: 486). </s></p><p n="p3.41"><s n="s1.3;p3.41">The method of modification, the final shape of the head and the decision on how long the deforming apparatus remains in place may be dictated at various social levels; by the 'tribe', the family or by the opinion of the midwife (Hasluck 1947: 130). </s><s n="s2.3;p3.41">For whatever reason cranial modification is undertaken, the practice is worldwide and spans prehistory through to historic periods. </s><s n="s3.3;p3.41">The methodology involved in cranial modification in addition to ethnographic and archaeological examples will be provided within this paper. </s></p><p n="p4.41"><s n="s1.4;p4.41">Pathological conditions can result in various forms of modification from mild, benign deviation from the mean to severe deformation incompatible with life. </s><s n="s2.4;p4.41">It has long been recognised that a child sleeping on a resistant surface may lead to occipital-parietal flattening (Hrdlička 1919; Ortner &amp; Putschar 1981); possible examples have been recovered including an asymmetrical female with mastoid deformity from Paucarcancha, Peru, (MacCurdy 1923). </s><s n="s3.4;p4.41">The Classical Greek author Pliny reported a "monstrous birth" was considered a portent (Rackham 1942: 529). </s><s n="s4.4;p4.41">Physical characteristics were at the time thought to have occurred due to sights, sounds or thoughts at the time of conception (ibid). </s></p><p n="p5.41"><s n="s1.4;p5.41">Synostosis or premature fusion of sutures of the cranium will lead to various degrees of deformation dependant on the quantity and location of the sutures involved (Resnick 2002). </s><s n="s2.4;p5.41">Some genetic conditions can result in cranial deformity and chromosome disorders incorporate many symptoms and/or deformities occasionally including modification of the skull, for example Trisomy 13 and Down's syndromes (ibid). </s><s n="s3.4;p5.41">In addition to such conditions, there is evidence that diet can factor into cranial deformity; vitamin and/or mineral deficiency or alcohol abuse may result in conditions including microcephaly (Martin 2005; McPherson 2004, <seg type="URL" n="http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/003272.htm"/>). </s><s n="s4.4;p5.41">The conditions and severity of pathological cranial deformity are vast, some of which will be addressed within this paper. </s></p><p n="p6.41"><s n="s1.3;p6.41">When examining human remains for pathological conditions, differential diagnosis should be considered. </s><s n="s2.3;p6.41">To accept an initial interpretation may result in evidence being overlooked, misdiagnosis and neglect in considering an alternative condition. </s><s n="s3.3;p6.41">This paper will describe the process undertaken during artificial head modification and pathological conditions resulting in a similar appearance;

determination between unintentional cradle-boarding and head-binding can be difficult (Anton 1989: 254). </s><s n="s3.3;p7.41">In addition, characteristic similarities suggest pathological conditions could be mistaken for intentional modification and such occurrences should be avoided. </s></p><p n="p8.41"><s n="s1.2;p8.41">Hominid species other than <hi rend="italic">Homo sapiens</hi> resulted in misinterpretation during early work, for example Knox (1863) description of a skull recovered from Neandertal, Germany. </s><s n="s2.2;p8.41">Prior to the classification of the Neandertal species, Knox was correct when he described the skull as round with prominent brow ridges and having "the resemblance to the chimpanzee, but not a gorilla" (Knox 1863: 272) and suggested the cranium was not deformed "by mechanical means or otherwise" (ibid); however, misinterpretation did occur upon the examination of the long bones; the robustness was attributed to retained foetal characteristics (ibid). </s></p><p n="p9.41"><s n="s1.1;p9.41">The recovery of a lone abnormal skull from a cemetery of average crania suggests a benign origin rather than intentional modification (Wells 1967: 6); conversely, recovery of both artificially modified skulls from the same cemetery as unmodified crania may suggest the presence of two distinct cultures within the region (Knox 1863: 272) or alternatively, a race that has desisted in using such methods. </s></p><p n="p10.41"><s n="s1.4;p10.41">Finally, differences between individual cases of artificial modification need to be carefully considered. </s><s n="s2.4;p10.41">Defining factors include the duration and position of the deforming apparatus on the cranium (Blackwood &amp; Danby 1955; Trinkaus 1983;), the tension and material density of the bands (Stewart 1941; Hasluck 1947), unintentional movement and the width of the band (Özbek 2001), and the healing response of the bones of the individual (Stewart 1941: 344). </s><s n="s3.4;p10.41">These elements will not only affect the shape produced but the level of deformity visible in the adult (Trinkaus 1982). </s><s n="s4.4;p10.41">The degree of resulting deformation has been graded by different authors using various terminology; in this paper, for the purpose of clarity, the grades of unmodified, modified and extremely modified have been adopted. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined bold">Artificial cranial modification</head><quote lang="English">"History informs us that in very ancient times a belief prevailed that by mechanical means applied to the head of the infant, another form might be given to it than that intended by nature". (Knox 1863: 271)</quote><p n="p11.41"><s n="s1.3;p11.41">The frontal flattening with excess curvature of the occipital bones of Neandertal remains recovered from the upper levels of Layer D of Shanidar Cave, Iraq, suggest artificial cranial modification has apparently been undertaken since at least 45,000 years BP (Trinkaus 1982; 1983). </s><s n="s2.3;p11.41">Similar treatment has been identified throughout the world and in geographical regions with the adoption of artificial cranial deformation, the occurrence rate appears to be high; in analysis of 1515 skeletons from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras, 88.65% displayed evidence of modification by the use of cradleboards (Tiesler 1999 <seg type="URL" n="http://www"/>. mesoweb.com/features/tielser/media/headshaping.pdf). </s><s n="s3.3;p11.41">The flat-headed race identified by Hippocrates extended from the ancient shore of the Euxine to central Europe (Knox 1863); this may suggest migration of modified individuals (Özbek 2001) and/or adoption of the fronto-occipital deformation practice by observers. </s></p><p n="p12.41"><s n="s1.3;p12.41">The motivation behind the practice varied and apparently included symbols of status, aesthetic pleasure (Blackwood &amp; Danby 1955), religious symbolism (Hrdlička 1919) and possibly tribal identification (de la Vega 1966: 485). </s><s n="s2.3;p12.41">An unintentional combination of multiple factors can be recognised; although attributed to aesthetics, the Greeks and Vlachs preferred round heads, while the Konia Turks would flatten the forehead and increase the height of their naturally large crania (Hasluck 1947: 130), coincidentally providing a cultural marker. </s><s n="s3.3;p12.41">The process of modification begins soon after birth, possibly immediately following the postpartum bath, usually by a woman, most commonly the mother or another person present at the birth (ibid; Hasluck 1947). </s></p><p n="p13.41"><s n="s1.2;p13.41">Evidence suggests in some cultures the practice is a custom involving predominantly female children, possibly including the Chalcolithic people of Değirmentepe, Turkey, based on tentative sex determination of children (Özbek 2001), however, others have an even divide between the sexes, such as the prehistoric Peruvian Ancon (Cheverud et al 1992) and some Mayan civilisations (Tiesler 1999 <seg type="URL" n="http://www.mesoweb.com/features/tielser/media/headshaping.pdf"/>). </s><s n="s2.2;p13.41">In groups where both sexes have undergone modification, variation can still be seen; examples recovered from New Britain suggested the females underwent head-binding for a longer period than the men due to the greater deformity seen in the specimens (Blackwood &amp; Danby 1955: 187). </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="underlined bold">Head-binding</head><p n="p14.41"><s n="s1.2;p14.41">The act of binding was possibly significant in the early life of the child; anthropomorphic figurines musical instruments used during pre-Hispanic rites suggest the process of head-shaping was perhaps commemorated ceremonially (fig 1) (Tiesler 1999, <seg type="URL" n="http://www.mesoweb.com/features/tielser/media/head"/> shaping.pdf). </s><s n="s2.2;p14.41">Symbolic meaning may explain the burial of an individual with in-situ deforming apparatus including a child from Moquegua, Peru (fig 2) (Ubelaker 2000) and the occasional adult (Aufderheide &amp;

bands of various material encircled the head of the neonatal infant, evidenced by the remains of the Moquegua infant (fig 2), occasionally with the addition of small boards or hard pads (de la Vega 1966; Aufderheide &amp; Rodriguez-Martin 1998). </s><s n="s2.4;p15.41">The position of the bands did not dictate the final shape. </s><s n="s3.4;p15.41">The tightness of the band, which appears to have been adjusted daily (ibid; Aufderheide &amp; Rodriguez-Martin 1998), and the overall length of time the apparatus remained in place would affect the appearance into adulthood (Özbek 2001), however, minimal deformation would be visible after only one day (Blackwood &amp; Danby 1955). </s><s n="s4.4;p15.41">Some children would be head-bound until the desired shape was achieved, for a year or until they could walk (Trinkaus 1982), up to three years (Aufderheide &amp; Rodriguez-Martin 1998), or until the child possessed the ability to remove the band (Blackwood &amp; Danby 1955; Trinkaus 1982). </s></p><p n="p16.41"><s n="s1.4;p16.41">The people of New Britain would 'paint' the infant's head with a black mixture of charred <hi rend="italic">magas</hi> wood and water prior to the application of the band; this was said to make the binding more effective (Blackwood &amp; Danby 1955). </s><s n="s2.4;p16.41">Following any initial preparation, all cultures apparently began the head-binding process with a band encircling the head, from the frontal bone at a level above the orbit, over the parietal region to the occipital bone (Özbek 2001). </s><s n="s3.4;p16.41">The ears were carefully flattened against the head; the band would cover the entire ear of an infant or just the tips of an older child (Blackwood &amp; Danby 1955). </s><s n="s4.4;p16.41">The band itself was of various materials although can be identified as flexible due to a lack of flattening (Trinkaus 1982: 199; 1983:147); the cultures of New Britain would generally use a bark-cloth bandage, a strip of which was removed from the loin cloth of the men, however, one man wore a silk loin cloth, having obtained the fabric while working as a labourer in Rabaul; this too was utilised for the bandage of his child (Blackwood &amp; Danby 1955). </s></p><figure id="BAWE_6171a-pic.003"><head>Fig 3: An infant of 6-7 months from Değ irmentepe, Turkey, displaying deformation (left) caused by the circular band in an artistic representation (right) (after Ö zbek 2001)</head></figure><p n="p17.41"><s n="s1.6;p17.41">A Chalcolithic infant from Değirmentepe, Turkey, of only 6-7 months of age was identified as having undergone modification with the use of one band (Özbek 2001) (fig 3). </s><s n="s2.6;p17.41">Additional bands were often added to the first phase single band as the child grew or when the head reached the desired volume, often after the child reached 12 months old (ibid). </s><s n="s3.6;p17.41">Individuals who have undergone multi-band modification can be identified through the bulge that developed between the bands (Özbek 2001) and included the Poroi Vlachs who occasionally secured a second band beneath the chin and over the crown to shorten the face (Hasluck 1947). </s><s n="s4.6;p17.41">An example of the dual-banding form of modification, recovered from Değirmentepe (ibid), displays the intra-band bulge. </s><s n="s5.6;p17.41">The infant, approximately 18 months old, was apparently head-bound with two bands passing over the frontal bone and lower portion of the parietals and occipital (fig 4A), resulting in a superior-posterior projection of the superior portion of the parietals and upper part of the occipital: the circular form of modification, also known as circumferential or Aymara type, (fig 4B) (ibid). </s><s n="s6.6;p17.41">These two infants provide valuable evidence of the stages children underwent during the process of modification. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_6171a-pic.004"><head>Fig 4: An artistic representation of the circular band (A) used during the cranial modification of an infant of 18 months from Değ irmentepe, Turkey (B) (after Ö zbek 2001)</head></figure><p n="p18.41"><s n="s1.3;p18.41">The preferred shape of the modified cranium would differ from region to region. </s><s n="s2.3;p18.41">Within the culture of the Maya, the people of the various regions would shape the heads of their infants slightly differently;

Danby 1955); pressure on the spinal cord as a result of the relocation or distortion of the foramen magnum has been linked in pathological conditions such as achondroplasia, dwarfism, to apnea and sudden death (Resnick 2002: 4451). </s><s n="s5.6;p29.41">Cradle-boarding in its nature appears to have little or no affect to the face. </s><s n="s6.6;p29.41">Modification is apparently restricted to the occipital or lambdoidal regions with asymmetric size difference without affecting the cranial base or face (Kohn et al 1995). </s></p><p n="p30.41"><s n="s1.6;p30.41">Hippocrates considered over time the artificially altered cranial shape had become an inherited characteristic, in addition, with the increased contact between populations the practice was eventually rendered obsolete (Chadwick &amp;
