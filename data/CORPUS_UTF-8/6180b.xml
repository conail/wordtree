the Cold war period and analyzes the extent to which changes have occurred. </s><s n="s2.4;p1.25">It is necessary to start with a definition of diplomacy where we distinguish between the actors, the functions and the agenda of diplomacy. </s><s n="s3.4;p1.25">Then we proceed with a short description of Cold war diplomacy, as this will also provide us with a theoretical background for further arguments and comparison. </s><s n="s4.4;p1.25">An analysis of the evolution of diplomacy thus relies on aspects identified by the definition and aims to elucidate to what extent changes have occurred. </s></p><p n="p2.25"><s n="s1.5;p2.25">The paper discusses changes in diplomatic actors, developments of multilateral and regional diplomacy, evolution of personal diplomacy and public diplomacy, and the shifts in agenda of diplomacy. </s><s n="s2.5;p2.25">The most important development occurred in emergence of new actors, new style of diplomacy and evolution of new multilateral agenda. </s><s n="s3.5;p2.25">It seems that the major change is the emergence of transnational diplomacy. </s><s n="s4.5;p2.25">Where Cold war diplomacy reflected the interstate or intergovernmental negotiates and national interests, we can argue that the modern diplomacy involves a greater degree of complexity and we can meaningfully assert that major changes have occurred in the field. </s><s n="s5.5;p2.25">While Nicolson argues that "to talk about new and old diplomacy is to make a distinction without difference," (Monsieur Jules Cambon in Nicolson 1988: 29) there are good arguments maintaining that more than just the 'outward appearance of diplomacy' has gradually changed. </s></p><p n="p3.25"><s n="s1.1;p3.25">The three major sources of change identified in the essay involve the end of the Cold war conflict itself, advances of globalisation and integration of the global society, and the 9/11 attacks on USA. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Definition

they are the agents who participate in the conduct of diplomatic communication and negotiations. </s><s n="s3.3;p5.25">Moreover, one needs to recognize the diverse themes and topics on diplomacy agenda and actors use distinct strategies or styles of negotiations. </s></p><p n="p6.25"><s n="s1.2;p6.25">Lastly, diplomacy fulfils several functions: negotiation, representation, identify and

actors where bilateral negotiates behind 'closed doors' were the preferred. </s><s n="s3.5;p7.25">Ambassadors and foreign ministers as representatives of government played an important role in diplomacy decision making. </s><s n="s4.5;p7.25">International institutions predominantly served interests of the most powerful states and negotiations outcomes dependent on state's relative power.

to throw off the communist regimes, elect democratic governments and pursue independent diplomacy. </s><s n="s4.6;p8.25">Changing balance of power fragmented the rigidity and cohesiveness of old

globalisation found their power fading away, while non-state actors (private sector and MNCs) gained power. </s><s n="s2.9;p9.25">Governments, as representatives of the states and principal agents in diplomacy, were forced to change their negotiation strategies as a result of their decreasing power. </s><s n="s3.9;p9.25">New actors were able to join and to a certain degree affect the diplomatic dialogue. </s><s n="s4.9;p9.25">This was partly initiating or at least encouraged by some governments as the new non-state, in particularly the private sector was supposed to share the burden of conducting diplomacy, while trying to stay as agenda setters. </s><s n="s5.9;p9.25">(Bayne 2003) Particularly in economic diplomacy businesses have been able to create various bodies and ad hoc
