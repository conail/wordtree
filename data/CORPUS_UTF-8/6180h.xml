options. </s><s n="s4.7;p12.24">(Evnine 1991) By giving meaning of each possibility, he provided an account of meaning for ambiguous sentences based on truth conditions. </s><s n="s5.7;p12.24">If we interpret Q&amp;C in a sensible way we should be able to use the TC approach to determine their meaning where the meaning of the Q&amp;C in question would be a function of the interpretation. </s><s

speaker of the sentence wants to know whether the sky is blue" is a fact stating declarative sentence which can be understood in terms of the TC approach. </s><s n="s2.2;p14.24">It also spells out meaning of the question. </s></p><p n="p15.24"><s n="s1.1;p15.24">An example including a command (""Go home!" is true iff the speaker ordered me to go home.") also seems to work as the interpretation/translation approach seems to provide us with translations of Q&amp;C which in turn can be analyzed using the D's theorems. </s></p><p n="p16.24"><s n="s1.7;p16.24">The problem now seems to be that we need to base our interpretation on something. </s><s n="s2.7;p16.24">A correct translation or interpretation is a translation which is meaning preserving. </s><s n="s3.7;p16.24">(Miller 1998) But if we want to maintain that the translation is correct we need to rely on something to guarantee this. </s><s n="s4.7;p16.24">Here we could rely on compositionality again but we still need to make sense of the 'what, when, where etc'. </s><s n="s5.7;p16.24">To make a correct translation we need to rely on understanding of the meaning of Q&amp;C in the first place. </s><s n="s6.7;p16.24">But we have no way of justifying that our understanding is correct. </s><s n="s7.7;p16.24">Thus more is needed to show that a truth conditional theory of meaning can make sense of Q&amp;C. </s></p><p n="p17.24"><s n="s1.6;p17.24">Lycan proposes a different way to deal with the problem. </s><s n="s2.6;p17.24">(Lycan 2000) One of his arguments suggests that at least some Q&amp;C have bi-polar truth-like semantic values as they describe a certain state of affairs which may or may not be true. </s><s n="s3.6;p17.24">Q&amp;C have bipolar values in the sense that questions can be answered by "yes" or "no" and commands can be obeyed or ignored. </s><s n="s4.6;p17.24">Thus they can have positive or negative semantic value. </s><s n="s5.6;p17.24">These can be used in a semantic analysis as truth-values. </s><s n="s6.6;p17.24">Consequently, we can analyze Q&amp;C with bi-polar truth-like values in terms of the TC theory of meaning. </s></p><p n="p18.24"><s n="s1.5;p18.24">However, this solution does not apply to all types of questions as not all of them have bipolar truth-like values. </s><s n="s2.5;p18.24">Questions like 'what, where, when etc' can be answered by a range of answers and thus take a number of different semantic values. </s><s n="s3.5;p18.24">Multi-polar questions however cannot be analyzed in the same way as questions with bipolar semantic value. </s><s n="s4.5;p18.24">Thus we now need a way to deal with multi-polar questions. </s><s n="s5.5;p18.24">Still it seems that commands at least can be dealt in this way as commands can only be obeyed or ignored and therefore can be associated with a bipolar semantic value. </s></p><p n="p19.24"><s n="s1.7;p19.24">One way to deal with multi-polarity of sentences is to accept that there are several possible semantic values a question can take and try to rely on inference to solve the problem. </s><s n="s2.7;p19.24">We still rely on Tarski's approach to make sense of fact-stating declarative sentences, but we make sense of question by inference based on the possible set of answers. </s><s n="s3.7;p19.24">The meaning of a question and consequently understanding it would thus be a matter of knowing the possible answers to it. </s><s n="s4.7;p19.24">This does not require knowing the correct answer. </s><s n="s5.7;p19.24">If someone asks us for time we normally have to check our clock to give him the correct answer. </s><s n="s6.7;p19.24">We infer meaning of the question as we know the possible answers to it and understand these based on the TC approach. </s><s n="s7.7;p19.24">This avoids the multi-polarity problem but only at the cost of indirectly relying on TC approach and introducing the notion of inference which clearly needs a detailed account. </s></p><p n="p20.24"><s n="s1.2;p20.24">However, we still need a tool to identify the correct sets of possible answers so that we can infer the meaning of the question itself. </s><s n="s2.2;p20.24">It does not really solve the problem as it is not clear how in particular are to infer from knowing about the set of answer that the question asks for one particular of them.
