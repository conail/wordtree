n="p2.21"><s n="s1.5;p2.21">When comparing grass silage with maize silage, maize can have a benefit over grass when feeding as forage to beef cattle. </s><s n="s2.5;p2.21">Such examples are that as maize matures, the digestibility remains relatively constant at around 70% as the grain develops. </s><s n="s3.5;p2.21">Whereas grass on the other hand, looses its digestibility as the grain develops (Jones, 2001). </s><s n="s4.5;p2.21">Another example is that currently the British weather has a sunnier, drier summer periods, which can cause grass to burn and wilt in the hot weather. </s><s n="s5.5;p2.21">Maize tends to cope better in this heat due to the plant's origin in Mesoamerica. </s></p><p n="p3.21"><s n="s1.7;p3.21">The use of maize instead of grass can cause different rates of gain in cattle due to the different nutritional values of the types of silage. </s><s n="s2.7;p3.21">Figure 1 shows the different chemical make-up of the two types of silage on a percentage basis. </s><s n="s3.7;p3.21">The column chart shows that grass contains a higher proportion of neutral detergent fibre compared to maize. </s><s n="s4.7;p3.21">This is due to the higher cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin composition in grass silage. </s><s n="s5.7;p3.21">Grass also contains lower, or no starch content compared to maize silage which has a high proportion of starch. </s><s n="s6.7;p3.21">The lower NDF and higher starch leads to higher intakes of dry matter in maize is provided as the main source of fodder. </s><s n="s7.7;p3.21">The high dry matter also ensures that there is a rapid drop in pH when put into silage, aiding the fermentation processes. </s></p><p n="p4.21"><s n="s1.2;p4.21">There is however, a lower proportion of crude protein in maize silage. </s><s n="s2.2;p4.21">Therefore, a higher concentrate is needed to supply the same amount of crude protein that is present in grass silage. </s></p><p n="p5.21"><s n="s1.1;p5.21">When contemplating the change to a different feed source, it is best to ensure that the composition and appearance of the final beef carcass will not deter the consumer from purchasing the product, which will cause a reduction in the carcass price. </s></p><figure id="BAWE_6181c-fig.001"><head>Fig 1: Nutritional composition of grass and maize silage</head></figure><table id="BAWE_6181c-tab.001"><head>Table 1:

the preparation, cooking, and eating satisfaction, which the consumer cannot be provided with at the point of purchase. </s><s n="s5.7;p6.21">Therefore, the middle priorities on the scale are the most informative decisions that sell the product. </s><s n="s6.7;p6.21">The visual characteristics such as the colour of the meat and fat, and how much fat is shown are therefore very important in selling the beef to the desired consumer market. </s><s n="s7.7;p6.21">To assess the difference in finishing beef cattle with either grass silage, maize silage, or a mixture of the two, the following method

increased the dry matter intake and lead to increases in metabolisable energy intake, daily liveweight gain, and thus carcass gain. </s><s n="s2.6;p17.21">This can be attributed to the nutrient composition of maize silage. </s><s n="s3.6;p17.21">The reduction of neutral detergent fibre, and increase in starch content, in maize silage leads to an increase in dry matter intake providing more energy for digestion, and therefore, growth- all in a shorter period than a grass silage diet. </s><s n="s4.6;p17.21">The energy that is provided to the steers is used for lean tissue growth first, with the excess being stored in the fat depots. </s><s n="s5.6;p17.21">Forrest and Vanderstoep (1985) found that all carcasses fed a maize diet received the highest carcass classifications, whereas only 80% that were fed on grass-based silage received the same standard. </s><s n="s6.6;p17.21">This supports the results given of a higher carcass weight, and killing out percentage, producing a higher carcass standard in maize-fed steers. </s></p><p n="p18.21"><s n="s1.6;p18.21">The results showed no significant increases in lean tissue between the diets, indicating that the steers were provided with enough energy- with all the diets producing layers of fat. </s><s n="s2.6;p18.21">In the case of maize, which is high in energy, a larger proportion was stored in the cod depot. </s><s n="s3.6;p18.21">Although higher fat deposition in these steers, the appearance of the fat may have become more desirable to the consumer by the whitish-cream appearance. </s><s n="s4.6;p18.21">Knight <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s5.6;p18.21">(1998) found that the carotenoid concentration in fat accounted for 60% of the variation, and not by the fat depth of the depots. </s><s n="s6.6;p18.21">Therefore, the low carotenoid concentrations present in maize silage may have resulted in the whiter fat. </s></p><p n="p19.21"><s n="s1.6;p19.21">The level of marbling in the lean tissue was not measured in this experiment. </s><s n="s2.6;p19.21">Albrecht <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> </s><s n="s3.6;p19.21">(2006) concluded that Holstein- Friesian cows had a more numerous, finer level of intramuscular fat than other breeds of cattle that were studied. </s><s n="s4.6;p19.21">Consumers visually prefer both low and high levels of marbling in beef- depending on individual preferences (Killingeral. 2004). </s><s n="s5.6;p19.21">Therefore, the amount of intramuscular fat that was present in the meat from this study would still be desired by a certain consumer market.The low bone growth can in all the diets is due to that the steers were being finished-off, therefore were reaching maturity and most bone growth would have already occurred prior to the experimental trial. </s><s n="s6.6;p19.21">Any small bone growth would have been in a lateral direction to strengthen the bones of the steer. </s></p><p n="p20.21"><s n="s1.5;p20.21">The experimental results showed no change in the pH of the lean muscle tissue. </s><s n="s2.5;p20.21">This shows that the change in diet doesn't result in a loss of glycogen stores that are available to be converted to lactic acid and reduce the pH to the acceptable range of 5.4-5.7 once the steer has been slaughtered. </s><s n="s3.5;p20.21">A low pH would have also resulted in the colour of the meat to darken. </s><s n="s4.5;p20.21">However, the trial concluded that there was no change in the colour of the lean tissue content. </s><s n="s5.5;p20.21">As low glycogen levels would be an indicator of stress or poor nutrition (MLA, 2006), the change from grass to maize silage during the finishing period doesn't affect the well-being of the animal. </s></p><p n="p21.21"><s n="s1.2;p21.21">This experiment believes that where geographically possible (such as southern Britain), growing maize as the main source of silage will give an advantage in carcass yield with a decrease in weeks to finish that steers would have to be on. </s><s n="s2.2;p21.21">This would give a higher profit to the farmer, and maintain consumer acceptance of the final meat product. </s></p></div1></body><back><div1
