organoleptic qualities can be better maintained in glucose syrups then they can in sucrose as they cannot be hydrolyzed further even in the presence of very acidic fruits. </s><s n="s11.11;p17.60">They have a favourable effect on the product, prevent the flow of aromatic compounds from the fruit to the syrup and moderate the acid taste better than does a sucrose at a given sweetness level. </s></p><p n="p18.60"><s n="s1.3;p18.60">A strong sucrose concentration in the syrup creates a higher gradient between the syrup and the fruit, and favours diffusion of fluids from the fruit to the syrup. </s><s n="s2.3;p18.60">During storage, the dry extractable matter diffuses from the syrup into the tissues, which results in an increase drained weight up to the establishment of the final equilibrium. </s><s n="s3.3;p18.60">Therefore the yield (drained weight) is dependent upon the packing medium composition, the particle size, and the shape of the fruit.

the correct weight. </s><s n="s4.7;p19.60">The removal of the gas also reduces the oxidation of the product, maintains vacuum in the can, and prevents corrosion. </s><s n="s5.7;p19.60">Blanching gives the product another washing treatment and inactivates enzymes which may cause deterioration of the food. </s><s n="s6.7;p19.60">Enzyme inactivation is not as important to canned foods as it is for frozen foods, as canned foods receive a far greater heat treatment during thermal processing of the can. </s><s n="s7.7;p19.60">Typical blanch times in near boiling water are 60 to 90 secs for small

in a heat exchanger which in turn is used to heat the water in the preheat section, providing economy in the use of water and energy. </s></p><p n="p21.60"><s n="s1.4;p21.60">Steam Blanching is quite common since almost all the canneries have an adequate supply of low-pressure steam. </s><s n="s2.4;p21.60">The simplest design has a metal mesh conveyor that moves through a tunnel with steam jets located under the conveyor. </s><s n="s3.4;p21.60">To minimise the e loss of steam the two ends are closed by curtains. </s><s n="s4.4;p21.60">This method is inexpensive and easy to manufacture but they are prone to temperature variations due to the effect of air currents. </s></p><p n="p22.60"><s n="s1.2;p22.60">Blanching under higher steam pressures increase the temperature, improves steam convection, increases the blanching rate, decreases steam loss, and produces higher reduction in the microbial contamination. </s><s n="s2.2;p22.60">Airlocks limit the loss of steam and further heat

sealed container. </s><s n="s5.9;p23.60">Excessive head space can result in an excess of air in the final product, which can result in an excess of air in the final product, which can accelerate product oxidation and eventually cause internal container corrosion. </s><s n="s6.9;p23.60">Insufficient head space can lead to permanent deformation of the container ends possible leakage due to the expansion of the product and contained gases, which would render the product unsaleable. </s><s n="s7.9;p23.60">During thermal processing, the product is in continuous contact with the hot cover liquid osmotic exchanges take place. </s><s n="s8.9;p23.60">Therefore, the solid components of some products during thermal treatment and to a lesser degree during storage are going to either take on or lose weight. </s><s n="s9.9;p23.60">Fill weights must compensate for any gain or loss. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Exhausting </head><p n="p24.60"><s

especially that trapped in the small spaces between containers in the load. </s><s n="s5.9;p32.60">Even a small quantity of air has a significant effect upon temperature. </s><s n="s6.9;p32.60">For e.g. any given location 10% of air by volume will reduce the temperature by about 3˚C, which will have a dramatic effect on product sterilisation. </s><s n="s7.9;p32.60">This means that in order to bring about efficient and uniform heating, air must be purged, or vented from the retort at the start of the process. </s><s n="s8.9;p32.60">It was achieved at the start of the operating cycle by introducing high velocity steam into the retort. </s><s n="s9.9;p32.60">This steam was allowed to pass through the vessels at the bottom and exit through a vent at the top since the retort was a vertical orientation type. </s></p><p n="p33.60"><s n="s1.2;p33.60">In practice, the efficiency of the venting process can be monitored by measurement of the temperatures in various locations throughout the retort, and the time required to remove all the air is determined experimentally. </s><s n="s2.2;p33.60">At the end of the venting time the vent valve was closed and the retort
