Following on from this is claims that all substances within the Earth's core must exist as a gas due to very high temperatures. </s><s n="s2.2;p5.8">This of course is not true as no evidence suggests that just gas is found within the interior of the Earth, gas is found within magmas for example, but not on its own! </s></p><p n="p6.8"><s n="s1.2;p6.8">On page 25, the Professor says that the interior of the Earth cannot be water, gas or any known mineral as the Earth would not weigh what it does. </s><s n="s2.2;p6.8">He is right by saying it is not water or gas, but wrong by saying that it is composed of unknown minerals because the bulk of the Earth's interior is made up of well known minerals at that time, such as iron, nickel and magnesium. </s></p><p n="p7.8"><s n="s1.7;p7.8">Page 26 contains a sentence saying that the terrestrial nucleus could not be liquid as it would be effected by the gravitational pull of the moon and would subsequently cause massive, periodical worldwide earthquakes. </s><s n="s2.7;p7.8">Due to S-Waves not passing through the outer core of the Earth, then it can be inferred that the outer core is liquid as S-Waves do not pass through liquids and therefore this sentence is false. </s><s n="s3.7;p7.8">This page also contains a theory as to why the Earth's interior contains heat. </s><s n="s4.7;p7.8">The Professor claims that the Earth has been heated by combustion on its surface and that reactive metals such as sodium and potassium found at the surface ignite easily, and with rain, penetrate down into the Earth where they combust again with explosions and eruptions. </s><s n="s5.7;p7.8">This is what he claims creates volcanoes. </s><s n="s6.7;p7.8">This is not so as it is known that volcanoes occur where flowing magma with the mantle reaches the Earth's surface via plate boundary movement, fractures in the crust or hot spots in oceanic crust and then erupts, thus creating a volcano! </s><s n="s7.7;p7.8">It is also known that the heat of the interior is not from very reactive metals penetrating the crust and combusting generating heat, but from the decaying of radioactive elements such as uranium and thorium that drive convective currents transferring heat to the surface. </s></p><p n="p8.8"><s n="s1.3;p8.8">Professor Liedenbrock also quotes, "<hi rend="italic">there is no proof at all for this internal heat; my opinion is that there is no such thing".</hi> </s><s n="s2.3;p8.8">When looking at the Earth, there is much evidence to suggest the opposite. </s><s n="s3.3;p8.8">Volcanoes, greater temperatures found in deep boreholes and mine and hot springs all prove that immense internal heat exists. </s></p></div1></body><back/></text></TEI.2>
