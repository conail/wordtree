they would have made an extremely tempting target. </s><s n="s7.9;p2.15">Another point to consider is that the Vikings were pagans and did not believe in or fear the Christian's God, something that would usually have gone a long way to protecting a monastery from attack. </s><s n="s8.9;p2.15">However as with any historical account it is inevitable that a certain amount of bias would creep in and the priests would not have had the opportunity to see the situation from all sides. </s><s n="s9.9;p2.15">This is where archaeology steps in, to find physical evidence of all aspects of Viking life. </s></p><p n="p3.15"><s n="s1.7;p3.15">The Vikings were a seafaring people who relied on their ship building knowledge as well as their practical knowledge of the seas and oceans on which they sailed. </s><s n="s2.7;p3.15">Just the sight of a Viking warship off the coast of many countries was enough to spread terror and panic. </s><s n="s3.7;p3.15">The ships themselves were of exceptional design and came in two distinct classes, the longship and the warship. </s><s n="s4.7;p3.15">The longship ranged from 70 to 140ft in length while the more practical and easier to maneuver warship ranged from 70 to 80ft in length. </s><s n="s5.7;p3.15">Both had extremely shallow drafts which led to the ships having the ability to enter river systems as well as allowing them to come close to shore and even be beached for extended periods. </s><s n="s6.7;p3.15">The shallow drafts also allowed for speed and manoeuvrability which was essential in sea battles, over all ships of Scandinavian design had the advantage. </s><s n="s7.7;p3.15">Generally the ships were rowed by the warriors within and when they were adequately rested they could reach speeds of 8-10 knots. </s></p><p n="p4.15"><s n="s1.4;p4.15">In the late 1960s the remains of five 11 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century longships and warships were found at the entrance to Roskilde Fjord near Roskilde in Denmark. </s><s n="s2.4;p4.15">The ships were in a remarkable state of preservation and had been purposely sunk with stones placed inside their hulls. </s><s n="s3.4;p4.15">The position of the boats, in the main navigation channel, suggested that they had been placed there to protect the nearby city (the Danish capital at the time) from sea borne assault. </s><s n="s4.4;p4.15">This can lead to two conclusions, that the inhabitants were sufficiently worried about attack that measures needed to be taken and that they had ships to spare <hi rend="italic">(Renwick 1979: 7)</hi> </s></p><p n="p5.15"><s n="s1.6;p5.15">The excavation of these ships was an extremely lengthy and expensive process and required the building of a coffer dam which enclosed the area and allowed the water to be pumped out and drained. </s><s n="s2.6;p5.15">This meant that the excavation could proceed as if it was taking place on dry land. </s><s n="s3.6;p5.15">The results of the excavation provided archaeologists with very important data concerning Viking shipbuilding techniques and technology <hi rend="italic">(Renwick 1979: 7).</hi> </s><s n="s4.6;p5.15">It is obvious that the Vikings spent a lot of time, energy, experience and money on designing their warships. </s><s n="s5.6;p5.15">This helps to prove that they were a warlike race; the ships themselves match the descriptions given by the previously mentioned priest, which means that their depictions were accurate at least in one respect. </s><s n="s6.6;p5.15">Viking warships were perfectly designed for lightening fast raids and ambushes and were fearsome in aspect. </s></p><p n="p6.15"><s n="s1.5;p6.15">There is however another side to the story archeological evidence shows that warships weren't the only type of ship commonly used by the Vikings. </s><s n="s2.5;p6.15">Things had begun to change by the 10 <hi rend="sup">th</hi>-11 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> centuries and European society was beginning to settle down as nations began to form. </s><s n="s3.5;p6.15">The Vikings slowly began to turn from raiding to commerce, and they began to build a new generation of ships more suitable for this purpose and more characteristic of the generality of Viking shipping at that time. </s><s n="s4.5;p6.15">The most characteristic of these trading vessels was the Knarr or Hafskip which was used for long distance trade and features widely in the Icelandic saga as the principal vessel used for exploration and colonization. </s><s n="s5.5;p6.15">It was in these deep water high sides sailing ships that Bjarni Herjolfson and Lief Eriksson used in their voyages across the North Atlantic to the American continent. </s></p><p n="p7.15"><s n="s1.7;p7.15">References to the Knarr are abound in the Sagas, but there is even less evidence of them in Viking iconography, for much the same reasons that Greek and Roman Roundships are not well represented in classical iconography. </s><s n="s2.7;p7.15">But it was the Knarr and its derivatives which constituted the basis of Viking Sea trading and transport. </s><s n="s3.7;p7.15">These merchant vessels were built with a larger load capacity and for seaworthiness and stability rather than speed. </s><s n="s4.7;p7.15">These ships had a wider deck, shelter for the crew (unlike the warships where the crew had to sleep open to the elements) and a cargo hold in the middle of the ship. </s><s n="s5.7;p7.15">There have been a few archaeological sites where evidence for Viking trading has been found including the Askekarr ship which dates back as far the 8 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. </s><s n="s6.7;p7.15">This shows that the Vikings were not just interested in warfare and that they did indeed trade, hardly the sign of a society whose only interest was bloodshed there was another side to their culture. </s><s rend="italic" n="s7.7;p7.15">(Greenhill 1976: 215) </s></p><p n="p8.15"><s n="s1.5;p8.15">Due to their sea faring nature the Viking sphere of influence (as opposed to an empire comparable to the Roman and British empires) stretched from their homelands in Scandinavia to Constinople in the east to Greenland and North America in the west. </s><s n="s2.5;p8.15">Through out these realms there is much archaeological and historical evidence of their activities and wherever they went they made cultural and social impacts. </s><s n="s3.5;p8.15">Raiding was all very well for the yielding sporadic bursts of wealth but only trade could yield a regular income. </s><s n="s4.5;p8.15">It can be argued that the achievement of the Scandinavians as traders rather than raiders proved the more enduring and successful. </s><s n="s5.5;p8.15">The Vikings made use of various different methods for trading; they used simple fishing camps or minor trading stations, through to seasonal markets, densely settled towns and trading ports <hi rend="italic">(Renwick 1979: 20)</hi> </s></p><p n="p9.15"><s n="s1.4;p9.15">Recent excavations in Viking Age towns and market places have revealed a myriad of evidence for craft industries including debris from the making of everyday and luxury objects such as glass, amber, bone, antler, wood, iron, bronze and precious metals, as well as for subsidiary industries such as ship repairing and agricultural industry. </s><s n="s2.4;p9.15">The blacksmith, woodworker, bead-maker, specialist jeweler, horn-and antler-worker, leather-worker and stone carver all played an important part in Viking society and were the foundation of Viking society and trade. </s><s n="s3.4;p9.15">Many warriors were in fact skilled in other professions and were only part time raiders and warriors seeking to gain a reputation. </s><s rend="italic" n="s4.4;p9.15">(Sawyer 2001;
