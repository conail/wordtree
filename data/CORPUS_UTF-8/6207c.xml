n="p21.21"><s n="s1.4;p21.21">Our results also demonstrate very well the effects of both salting in and out as mentioned before. </s><s n="s2.4;p21.21">When other ions were introduced they reacted with the dissolved salt ions, removing them from the established equilibrium and hence forcing further generation (solubilization). </s><s n="s3.4;p21.21">This was illustrated by the rise in concentration of salt ions in solution B and demonstrates "salting in". </s><s n="s4.4;p21.21">Solution C introduced common ions which pushed the equilibrium towards the solid salt, lowering the concentration of iodate ions and hence the solubility decreased - an example of "salting out". </s></p></div1></body><back/></text></TEI.2>
