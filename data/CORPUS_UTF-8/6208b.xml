solution e.g. sodium hydroxide, is usually obtained from the laboratory and its concentration (molarity) is given on a label. </s><s n="s3.6;p4.34">To make this solution solid sodium hydroxide pellets have been weighed out and dissolved in a known volume of water. </s><s n="s4.6;p4.34">However the pellets are very hygroscopic (water absorbing) and this process occurs during weighing so that the exact amount of NaOH used is unknown. </s><s n="s5.6;p4.34">The final solution is also frequently contaminated with carbon dioxide which reacts to form sodium carbonate. </s><s n="s6.6;p4.34">Sodium
