whilst the depletion of sea fish stocks through over fishing means that on-shore fish farms may become more prevalent in coming years (Purvis, 2003). </s><s n="s2.5;p11.128">Warm water species such as Tilapia and Barramundi are already beginning to be farmed in intensive, indoor fish farms in the UK (New Forest Barramundi, 2006, Times Online, 2005). </s><s n="s3.5;p11.128">An increase in the number of Nitrate Vulnerable Zones in the last ten years (DEFRA 2005; Appendix 1) and concerns regarding the amount of nitrogenous waste entering the environment (Hooper, 2006) means these businesses may find it increasingly difficult to dispose of their waste products. </s><s n="s4.5;p11.128">In addition, industries such as horticulture and agriculture are also being made aware of the need to use non-renewable energy sources and water more wisely. </s><s n="s5.5;p11.128">Aquaponics goes some way to reducing the environmental impact of food production in the following ways: </s></p><list

can reduce the 'carbon footprint' by cutting down on pollution caused by transportation ("food miles") (ibid) </item><item>Increased crop yields compared with soil-based systems as well as conventional hydroponic systems (Savidov, 2006)</item></list><p n="p12.128"><s n="s1.1;p12.128">The above factors also go some way to increasing the profitability of both the aquaculture and horticultural produce. </s></p><p n="p13.128"><s n="s1.4;p13.128">Disadvantages in aquaponic production systems include high start-up costs and reliance upon skilled staff to create and maintain a nutrient-balanced system. </s><s n="s2.4;p13.128">Knowledge of both crop production and fish rearing is required, and thus most current systems are personal hobbies, small, family-run businesses, or academic demonstrations of the technique. </s><s n="s3.4;p13.128">The time required before the grower sees the benefits of an aquaponic system must also be seen as a drawback. </s><s n="s4.4;p13.128">It is currently estimated that growth in aquaponic systems will not reach its full potential until at least six, and ideally twelve months of operation (Savidov 2006). </s></p><p n="p14.128"><s n="s1.7;p14.128">The intensive nature of large-scale food production in the UK probably limits potential for diversification into aquaponics to smaller growers. </s><s n="s2.7;p14.128">One possibility, is for aquaponics to be used to produce organic fish and organic hydroponic fruits/vegetables under glass. </s><s n="s3.7;p14.128">However, current rulings, in the UK at least, by regulatory bodies such as The Soil Association stipulate that produce must be grown in soil to be certified organic. </s><s n="s4.7;p14.128">The need to work in harmony with soil flora and fauna means that even organically-derived nutrient solutions are not acceptable. </s><s n="s5.7;p14.128">It could be argued however that soilless growing preserves the soil-borne organisms as the soil is left completely undisturbed. </s><s n="s6.7;p14.128">Furthermore, recent work at the Crops Research Centre in Alberta, Canada suggests that the micro-organisms may be key to the success of an aquaponic system, Savidov (2006) noting that the 200% increase in Genovese basil yield over four years was likely due to bio-stimulants released by populations of benthic organisms. </s><s n="s7.7;p14.128">Atkin and Nichols (2004), using manure-derived nutrient solutions in conventional hydroponics, researched the possibility of organic hydroponics in New Zealand but the results were disappointing. </s></p><p n="p15.128"><s n="s1.8;p15.128">The major wastes from aquaculture and the major fertilisers for crop production are ammonia in its ionic form, ammonium (NH <hi rend="sub">4</hi>+) and nitrate (NO <hi rend="sub">3</hi>-), as well as phosphates (PO <hi rend="sub">4</hi>3-). </s><s n="s2.8;p15.128">Other chemical by-products of fish production may also serve as plant micronutrients. </s><s n="s3.8;p15.128">This has meant a wide range of crops, including cucumbers (<hi rend="italic">Cucumis sativus</hi>), beans (<hi rend="italic">Vicia faba</hi>) (McMurty, 1986), strawberries (<hi rend="italic">Fragaria x ananassa</hi>) (Takeda <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 1997), tomatoes (<hi rend="italic">Solanum lycopersicum</hi>) and melons (<hi rend="italic">Cucumis</hi> spp.) (UVI, 2001) have been successfully grown using aquaponics in previous experiments. </s><s n="s4.8;p15.128">A large proportion successful research, however has used lettuce and leafy herbs in the hydroponic component of the system, possibly because of its lower demand for potassium (K) (Resh, 1995), a nutrient not generally found in high concentrations in fish-culture water. </s><s n="s5.8;p15.128">Furthermore, with only one growth stage (as a commercial crop) lettuce does not generally require the change in nutrient formula of a fruiting crop such as tomatoes, as it begins to produce flowers and fruit (ibid). </s><s n="s6.8;p15.128">Lettuce is a widely grown crop in the UK and can be produced under glass all year-round. </s><s n="s7.8;p15.128">It is feasible that growers could consider using an aquaponic system to create a second income stream from fish farming alongside lettuce production, simultaneously reducing their fertiliser budget. </s><s n="s8.8;p15.128">It is possible to supplement the aquaculture water with plant nutrients harmless to fish (Rakocy <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, 2004, Chaves et al, 2000) or even grow fish in complete hydroponic nutrient solution (Seawright et al, 1998). </s></p><p n="p16.128"><s n="s1.5;p16.128">Previous studies in aquaponics have often been carried out as aquaculture-based research projects, the hydroponic crop being seen as a by-product of the low-tech biological filtration. </s><s n="s2.5;p16.128">The majority of these systems have farmed warm water Tilapia (<hi rend="italic">Oreochromis spp.</hi> </s><s n="s3.5;p16.128">) in the aquaculture portion of the system, as these fish reach saleable size quickly and tolerate high nitrate loading in their grow-out tanks (Dontje et al, 1999). </s><s n="s4.5;p16.128">Successful trials have been carried out using cold water species such as trout (McMurty, 1986), but owing to the lower stocking densities tolerated by cold water species (due to relatively high oxygen demand), research has tended to favour warm water species. </s><s n="s5.5;p16.128">Most studies have included edible fish; however, a proposed project to take place in the Netherlands will use ornamental fish (Aquaponics Journal, 2006). </s></p><figure id="BAWE_6214b-pic.001"><head rend="bold">Figure 1.2: Aquaponic lettuce production at the

effluent (Fig. </s><s n="s3.8;p17.128">1.2) (UVI, 2001, Rakocy, 2004). </s><s n="s4.8;p17.128">In substrate-based systems, the movement of the water through the medium provides aeration and can be used to provide mechanical solids filtering as well as providing the necessary surface to be colonised by nitrifying bacteria (Lennard &amp; Leonard, 2004, McMurty, 1986). </s><s n="s5.8;p17.128">Indeed the necessity of removing solid waste from aquaponic systems is a current cause of disagreement amongst hobbyists and researchers such as Rackocy, Lennard and Savidov. </s><s n="s6.8;p17.128">Anecdotal evidence from Rakocy at The University of the Virgin Islands also suggests that the balance of macro and micronutrients can be controlled by altering the amount of solid waste removed from the fish production element, although no work has been published in support of this theory. </s><s n="s7.8;p17.128">Jones (1997) also notes that non-ionic soil-borne substances such as amino acids, simple proteins, carbohydrates and urea can be assimilated in conventional soil-based cultivation by mass flow and contribute to plant growth. </s><s n="s8.8;p17.128">Substrate-filled grow beds may also have practical advantages such as temperature regulation and water-holding capacity if pumps fail. </s></p><p n="p18.128"><s n="s1.2;p18.128">Flood-and-drain and continuous flow irrigation have been trialled, with initial work suggesting that reciprocating flow (flood and drain) provided greater aeration and more even nutrient distribution through the substrate (McMurty, 1997 cited in Lennard &amp; Leonard, 2004). </s><s n="s2.2;p18.128">Lennard and Leonard (2004) however disproved this theory, attaining higher yield [lettuce], higher dissolved oxygen concentrations and smaller water losses from a continuous-flow irrigation system. </s></p><div3><head rend="bold">Hydroponic lettuce production</head><p n="p19.128"><s n="s1.2;p19.128">As Jones (1997) comments, although there Have been many published formulas for the preparation of hydroponic nutrient solutions from as long ago as the late 19 <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century, the appropriate tailoring of the concentration of each constituent to the crop and production method is still largely down to the personal preference of the grower. </s><s n="s2.2;p19.128">Madestein UK Ltd, a well established

maximum crop growth. </s><s n="s2.3;p20.128">Whilst many of these elements can have a deleterious effect on growth at high concentrations, supplying nutrients at supra-optimal levels ensures that assimilates are not used to produce excess root as the plant is forced to 'forage' for nutrition. </s><s n="s3.3;p20.128">Authors such as Resh (1995 and 2006) and Jones (1993) suggest the following

are not entirely understood (Lucas and Southgate 2003). </s><s n="s3.3;p21.128">Methaemoglobinemia, or 'blue baby syndrome' due to high levels if nitrate in drinking water, however is well documented

(Stickney 2005). </s><s n="s2.4;p22.128">High levels of nitrate and phosphate in such systems left unchecked lead to the build up of algae, which must be removed, adding to the operating costs. </s><s n="s3.4;p22.128">Intensive aquaculture systems, even those that recirculate water from the growth tanks, produce a high density of waste products, and must either remove a portion of the water (usually on a daily basis (New Forest Barramundi 2006)) to maintain acceptable levels of aqueous waste or remove unwanted compounds on site. </s><s n="s4.4;p22.128">This may be followed by water

reduce aquaculture profits and may mean large outlay for no return. </s><s n="s3.3;p23.128">Whilst a retrofitted hydroponics setup is costly, this outlay can be recouped from the sale of crops unlike

n="s2.3;p112.128">Salisbury &amp; Ross (1992) imply that this is most indicative of low nitrogen availability, which is borne out by low recorded NO <hi rend="sub">3</hi>- concentrations in the fish tanks of these treatments during these trials compared to the control tanks. </s><s n="s3.3;p112.128">Low levels of root production in the aquaponic treatments in trial 1 may also be indicative of low phosphorus availability at that early stage in the project. </s></p><p n="p113.128"><s n="s1.3;p113.128">Small necrotic spots surrounded by a yellow halo were also observed on the plants from the aquaponic treatments (Figure 3.21), which was identified as an early infection of <hi rend="italic">Xanthomonus campestris</hi> (Agrios 2005). </s><s n="s2.3;p113.128">Whilst necrotic lesions can also be indicative of magnesium deficiency, the symptoms were not confined to inter-venal regions, and thus the initial diagnosis was accepted. </s><s n="s3.3;p113.128">The control plants did not show any sign of such infection, one possible reason being the vigour with which they were growing. </s></p><p n="p114.128"><s n="s1.8;p114.128">The brown appearance of the roots of plants from the aquaponic treatments in the second trial would seem to suggest that there may have been at least some occurrence of anoxic pockets of water within the substrate, causing root death. </s><s n="s2.8;p114.128">Sampling of the dissolved oxygen in the irrigation water (when the water temperature was 17 °C) showed levels of approximately 8mg l <hi rend="sup">-1</hi>. </s><s n="s3.8;p114.128">This is within the desired range for freshwater aquaria and well above the minimum levels acceptable for good growth in hydroponic crops (Goto <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1996). </s><s n="s4.8;p114.128">Continuous flow systems through a substrate can lead to the water taking a 'path of least resistance' through the particles with some areas flooded but not moving. </s><s n="s5.8;p114.128">In such areas, denitrification (nitrate reduced to nitrogen gas) can even occur. </s><s n="s6.8;p114.128">Such a phenomenon would perhaps explain why some root tissue appeared necrotic. </s><s n="s7.8;p114.128">The root systems of these plants tended also to trap solid fish excreta and hence impede the flow of oxygenated water past the roots, possibly another reason for the root death. </s><s n="s8.8;p114.128">Dense root mats can be problematic in conventional Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) hydroponics where they can also starve themselves of oxygen by reducing solution penetration into the root mass (Jones 1997) </s></p><p n="p115.128"><s n="s1.5;p115.128">The fluctuations in nitrate content of the aquaria water during the first three trials would appear to suggest that the fish stocking rates and hence feed input were insufficient to produce the amount of nitrogen required by the plants. </s><s n="s2.5;p115.128">However, during the third trial, nitrate levels remained at 40 ppm for the entire trial. </s><s n="s3.5;p115.128">During this period (early October) day temperatures in the glasshouse were noticeably lower than in previous trials (Appendix 4). </s><s n="s4.5;p115.128">The corresponding fall in water temperature in the aquaria may have reduced the feeding rate of the fish, meaning less protein from the food was converted to fish biomass and more uneaten food may have merely decomposed than in previous trials. </s><s n="s5.5;p115.128">The lower temperatures also corresponded to lower rates of plant growth, and thus less demand for nitrogen, although nitrate concentrations in the control systems did fall in line with the two previous trials. </s></p><p n="p116.128"><s n="s1.3;p116.128">Higher growth rates (although not significantly) were observed in the aquaponic + Fe treatments in the first two trials but not in the third. </s><s n="s2.3;p116.128">Furthermore, only in the second trial did the addition if iron to the aquaponic systems have a significant effect on leaf chlorophyll content. </s><s n="s3.3;p116.128">The addition of iron did not therefore appear to have any consistent significant effect during the project. </s></p><p n="p117.128"><s n="s1.5;p117.128">Plants are able to grow well in soilless systems where mineral concentrations are as low as those in soil solutions, as long as the nutrients can be replenished at a comparable rate to their uptake (Salisbury and Ross 1992). </s><s n="s2.5;p117.128">This continual renewal is central to the success of an aquaponic system, where levels of nitrate, for example remain much lower than those found in conventional hydroponics. </s><s n="s3.5;p117.128">From a fish-rearing perspective, treatment of aquaculture effluents are seen as problematic, especially in open systems, as the large volume flows carry relatively dilute nutrients (Adler <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2000). </s><s n="s4.5;p117.128">Rackocy (no date) and Lennard (2004) have demonstrated the ability of aquaponic systems to produce leafy herbs when nitrate levels are as low as 40 ppm. </s><s n="s5.5;p117.128">It is theoretically possible to match nutrient production to nutrient uptake (at least for nitrogen) and thus for aquaponic systems to reach a nutrient equilibrium (Lennard 2004). </s></p><p n="p118.128"><s n="s1.3;p118.128">Plant scientists generally acknowledge the possibility that organic compounds such as vitamins can have a positive effect on plant growth (Salisbury and Ross 1992). </s><s n="s2.3;p118.128">The importance of chelating agents in the uptake of nutrients, especially relatively immobile ones, is also widely known, and in soils it is known that these chelating agents are often of microbial origin (ibid). </s><s n="s3.3;p118.128">Commercially available bio-stimulants for use in soilless systems aim to enhance inorganic nutrient uptake in a similar way and indeed, Vernieri <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (2006) proved the capability of one such substance to maintain yields of rocket (<hi rend="italic">Eruca sativa</hi>) when the nutrient content in a hydroponic system was reduced to 25% of normal levels. </s></p><p n="p119.128"><s n="s1.6;p119.128">In aquaponic systems, the understanding of the action of micro-organisms in the production of bio-stimulants is growing. </s><s n="s2.6;p119.128">The action of micro-organism-derived chelating agents as well as humic compounds from the breakdown of solid waste may well be a key factor in the success of aquaponics. </s><s n="s3.6;p119.128">Savidov (2006 cited in Wilson 2006) has highlighted the need for aquaponic systems to 'mature' in order to produce economic crop yields. </s><s n="s4.6;p119.128">The speed at which the system reaches this maturity would obviously be important to any business application of the technique. </s><s n="s5.6;p119.128">The aquaponic systems in this project began to produce comparable yields to the hydroponic control after approximately four months of operation. </s><s n="s6.6;p119.128">The decision not to remove solid fish waste may have been important in achieving this as the organic particles can act as carriers for bacteria and other beneficial micro-fauna (Kolkovski <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 2003) </s></p><p n="p120.128"><s n="s1.2;p120.128">Aquaculture-derived manure has been cited as a useful slow-release fertiliser (Westerman <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1993). </s><s n="s2.2;p120.128">Naylor <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (1999) analysed fresh trout-farm manure, finding levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium (Mg) on a dry-weight basis comparable with cattle, poultry and swine manures. </s></p><p n="p121.128"><s n="s1.2;p121.128">The amount of solid particles present in the system is also linked to the dissolved oxygen concentration, with the aerobic breakdown of excreta and uneaten food increasing the amount of oxygen removed from the water. </s><s n="s2.2;p121.128">This is the main reason why systems that are intensively stocked with fish, such as that of the UVI, remove solids (Rackocy no date). </s></p><p n="p122.128"><s n="s1.3;p122.128">Over the project as a whole, there were much lower levels of water use in the aquaponic systems. </s><s n="s2.3;p122.128">Whilst the control systems required a 100% water change between trials as well as supplementary water to replace that lost through evapotranspiration, the aquaponic systems only required the latter. </s><s n="s3.3;p122.128">Each aquaponic system thus used approximately 75% less water than the control. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Conclusion</head><p n="p123.128"><s n="s1.3;p123.128">The project demonstrated the ability of

aquaria as the nutrient source albeit at a slower rate than the control hydroponic treatment. </s><s n="s3.3;p123.128">The rate at which lettuce can be produced in these systems related directly to the amount of food added to the aquatic portion of the systems, which would normally be in direct relation to the stocking density of the fish used. </s></p><p n="p124.128"><s n="s1.2;p124.128">Although the hydroponic control treatments produced a greater crop yield in three of the four trials, it is worth considering the amount of water used and the cost in terms of financial outlay for the inorganic nutrients and in terms of the energy used to produce these chemicals. </s><s n="s2.2;p124.128">Aquaponic systems also have the advantage of producing two saleable products and, as has been demonstrated in the United States, the possibility of generating further income from agri-tourism. </s></p><p n="p125.128"><s n="s1.2;p125.128">Although there are obvious benefits to producing crops using aquaponic systems, the likelihood of commercial-scale aquaponic production occurring in the UK in the near future must be seen as unlikely. </s><s n="s2.2;p125.128">It is possible however, that large increases in energy costs and restrictions on water use and pollution discharge may make such techniques more important in years to come. </s></p></div1><div1 type="section"><head rend="bold">Future Work</head><p n="p126.128"><s n="s1.5;p126.128">It was apparent towards the end of this project that the expanded clay aggregate bio-filters/grow-beds were not large enough to cope with 5 months of goldfish faeces. </s><s n="s2.5;p126.128">It became necessary during the later trials to periodically remove the plug at the end of the irrigation hose to remove some solids from the pipe. </s><s n="s3.5;p126.128">Larger, deeper bio-filters would therefore enable the retention of more soild waste and possibly, therefore higher concentrations of micronutrients and micro-organisms. </s><s n="s4.5;p126.128">Lennard and Leonard (2006) assessed the comparative abilities of gravel bed, floating raft and NFT hydroponic systems to remove fish-derived nutrients in an aquaponics system, concluding gravel beds worked most efficiently. </s><s n="s5.5;p126.128">Combinations of grow-bed volume and various substrates could therefore be trialled along with the removal or retention of fish faeces. </s></p><p n="p127.128"><s n="s1.4;p127.128">Now suggested as being an important factor in aquaponic systems, populations of water borne micro flora and micro fauna take some time to establish. </s><s n="s2.4;p127.128">Savidov (2006 in Wilson 2006) has suggested that for populations of these organisms to reach useful size may take up to twelve months, and that from that point forward aquaponics can outperform conventional hydroponics in terms of crop yield. </s><s n="s3.4;p127.128">A full investigation of these theories is currently under way by Savidov (Wilson 2006), however the limited time-scale for this project must be cited as a major limiting factor in view of these preliminary hypotheses. </s><s n="s4.4;p127.128">Possibly, future research could assess the effects of commercially-available plant boistimulants in aquaponics where 'virgin' aquaculture systems are used to provide crop nutrition. </s></p><p n="p128.128"><s n="s1.1;p128.128">Finally, the increasing need to reduce energy consumption also presents the possibility of using warm water fish production alongside glasshouse crops to
