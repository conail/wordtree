September 1642, public theatres were closed on the grounds that the times were unfit for public sports. </s><s n="s2.6;p5.15">By creating this dramatic piece of political satire during this period, the writer, like so many others, displays his contempt for parliamentary decision and seeks a return to the conservative past. </s><s n="s3.6;p5.15">While these constraints cause him to write for a readership, rather than an audience, he comfortably uses theatrical devices throughout his play, such as the inset masque, promenading and soliloquy. </s><s n="s4.6;p5.15">These devices suggest an intention to perform the text which, in itself, undermines Parliament's authority, without the additional aggravation of inserting high-profile Reformists as leading characters in his play. </s><s n="s5.6;p5.15">The writer voices contempt for the 'beastly Ignorance' of the Reformists who initialised a project to 'raze, our Theaters to the ground' (VI). </s><s n="s6.6;p5.15">The use of antithesis in this criticism emphasises the devolutionary effect of the supposedly evolutionary Reform on the nation. </s></p><p n="p6.15"><s n="s1.11;p6.15">Potter observes that Parliament imposed transformation on old English customs, which led the Stuarts to become identified with 'the same golden past that had previously been associated with Elizabeth I' (Potter, <hi rend="italic">Secret

party as Parliament's "levelling" design was more attractive to the ordinary man. </s><s n="s5.11;p6.15">However, the writer's presentation of power-hungry Cromwell suggests that the abolition of social hierarchy is an unattainable ideal. </s><s n="s6.11;p6.15">He implies that, while Cromwell may publicly reject the hierarchical structure of the monarchy, he privately hopes that the regicide will earn him the crown. </s><s n="s7.11;p6.15">Cromwell's hypocrisy is particularly implied in his soliloquy where, in privacy from his army, the reader has the opportunity to witness his true thoughts. </s><s n="s8.11;p6.15">Following compliments to Peters' rhetorical skill in previous scenes, he does not hesitate to mock his 'deere Buffoone' (20) in his own company. </s><s n="s9.11;p6.15">Fairfax is also a victim of his leader's contempt. </s><s n="s10.11;p6.15">Cromwell's General and Commander in Chief is rejected as a 'silly Foole' (20) in private, and immediately transformed into 'our great Generall the Lord Fairfax' (21) when Cromwell is immersed in company. </s><s n="s11.11;p6.15">The writer implies that Cromwell is a dishonest and manipulative leader who, in elevating himself above his men, hypocritically parallels the structure of the monarchy and places himself in the highest possible position. </s></p><p n="p7.15"><s n="s1.1;p7.15">The inseparable
