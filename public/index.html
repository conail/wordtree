				<h1>The Word Tree Corpus Interface</h1>
			</header>

				<div id="overview">
					<h2>Rationale</h2>
					<p>In recent years a number of relatively small, highly targeted corpora have been created to support the investigation of specified  types of speech and writing, for the benefit of researchers, teachers and language students learning about the language requirements of specific domains - professional, academic or demographic.</p>
					<p>Generally the small corpora that are most used and cited are those which enable the easiest and fastest extraction of relevant data; potentially useful corpora are often underused because they lack an online interface, or offer an interface which is not completely fit for purpose because it was originally designed for lexicographers and information scientists working with much larger general corpora.</p>
					<p>This project will develop a multi-dimensional Word Tree interface which will allow users to search and browse term metrics within documents and across a corpus, and access instant visual representation of the language patterns surrounding any given word or phrase.  A facet browser for term collocations may possibly be integrated into the design, allowing advanced iterative search/browse behaviour.</p>
